Zappa: I would say that the basic characteristic of my life is failure. 
If there is one thing that I excel at, it's failure -- I manage to fail at 100 percent of the things that I do. 
Since most of the things that I set out to do are theoretically impossible, it's very easy to fail. 
I've learned to live with it. 
In terms of machinery and personnel, there never seems to be enough to get things done exactly right.

A "fragment" is a properly mapped read pair from an individual with a unique insert size. 
If two read pairs on a RAD site from an individual have the same insert size, they constitute only one fragment, i. e. one read pair is likely to be a PCR duplicate.}

\section{The layout of formal tables}
This section has been modified from ``Publication quality tables in \LaTeX*''
 by Simon Fear.

The layout of a table has been established over centuries of experience and 
should only be altered in extraordinary circumstances. 

When formatting a table, remember two simple guidelines at all times:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Never, ever use vertical rules (lines).
  \item Never use double rules.
\end{enumerate}

These guidelines may seem extreme but I have
never found a good argument in favour of breaking them. For
example, if you feel that the information in the left half of
a table is so different from that on the right that it needs
to be separated by a vertical line, then you should use two
tables instead. Not everyone follows the second guideline:

There are three further guidelines worth mentioning here as they
are generally not known outside the circle of professional
typesetters and subeditors:

\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item Put the units in the column heading (not in the body of
          the table).
  \item Always precede a decimal point by a digit; thus 0.1
      {\em not} just .1.
  \item Do not use `ditto' signs or any other such convention to
      repeat a previous value. In many circumstances a blank
      will serve just as well. If it won't, then repeat the value.
\end{enumerate}

A frequently seen mistake is to use `\textbackslash begin\{center\}' \dots `\textbackslash end\{center\}' inside a figure or table environment. This center environment can cause additional vertical space. If you want to avoid that just use `\textbackslash centering'
