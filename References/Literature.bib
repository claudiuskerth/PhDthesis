  Abstract                 = {Hybrid zones typically contain novel gene combinations that can be tested by natural selection in a unique genetic context. Parental haplotypes that increase fitness can introgress beyond the hybrid zone, into the range of parental species. We used the Affymetrix canine SNP genotyping array to identify genomic regions tagged by multiple ancestry informative markers that are more frequent in an admixed population than expected. We surveyed a hybrid zone formed in the last 100¬†years as coyotes expanded their range into eastern North America. Concomitant with expansion, coyotes hybridized with wolves and some populations became more wolflike, such that coyotes in the northeast have the largest body size of any coyote population. Using a set of 3102 ancestry informative markers, we identified 60 differentially introgressed regions in 44 canines across this admixture zone. These regions are characterized by an excess of exogenous ancestry and, in northeastern coyotes, are enriched for genes affecting body size and skeletal proportions. Further, introgressed wolf-derived alleles have penetrated into Southern US coyote populations. Because no wolves currently exist in this area, these alleles are unlikely to have originated from recent hybridization. Instead, they probably originated from intraspecific gene flow or ancient admixture. We show that grey wolf and coyote admixture has far-reaching effects and, in addition to phenotypically transforming admixed populations, allows for the differential movement of alleles from different parental species to be tested in new genomic backgrounds.},

The ENCODE Consortium is integrating multiple technologies and approaches in a collective effort to discover and define the functional elements encoded in the human genome, including genes, transcripts, and transcriptional regulatory regions, together with their attendant chromatin states and DNA methylation patterns. In the process, standards to ensure high-quality data have been implemented, and novel algorithms have been developed to facilitate analysis. Data and derived results are made available through a freely accessible database. Here we provide an overview of the project and the resources it is generating and illustrate the application of ENCODE data to interpret the human genome.},

  Abstract                 = {Crickets in the genus Laupala (subfamily Trigonidiinae) have an elaborate courtship system, defined by a highly ritualized serial transfer of multiple spermatophores. Males produce multiple "micro" spermatophores followed by a final "macro" spermatophore during a single mating bout. Remarkably, the microspermatophores of L. cerasina, the first species whose mating system was studied in detail, were discovered to be spermless. However, in a study of another species, L. pacifica, sperm transfer was reported after every copulation suggesting that L. pacifica microspermatophores contain sperm. The presence or absence of sperm in the microspermatophore has important implications for the evolution of this exaggerated courtship system and the origin of nuptial gifts. In this study, we systematically examined L. pacifica spermatophore contents for sperm using a fluorescent nuclear stain. We detected sperm only in macrospermatophores. This finding suggests that spermless microspermatophores are typical for Laupala; thus, to determine the origin of this highly modified phenotype will require comparative analyses with closely related outgroups that exhibit less exaggerated courtship systems.},

  Abstract                 = {We have shown that human genes associated with CpG islands increase in number as they increase in \% of guanine + cytosine (GC) levels, and that most genes associated with CpG islands are located in the GC-richest compartment of the human genome. This is an independent confirmation of the concentration gradient of CpG islands (detected as HpaII tiny fragments, or HTF) which was demonstrated in the genome of warm-blooded vertebrates [Aïssani and Bernardi, Gene 106 (1991) 173-183]. We then reassessed the location of CpG islands using the data currently available and confirmed that CpG islands are most frequently located in the 5'-flanking sequences of genes and that they overlap genes to variable extents. We have shown that such extents increase with the increasing GC levels of genes, the GC-richest genes being completely included in CpG islands. Under such circumstances, we have investigated the properties of the 'extragenic' CpG islands located in the 5'-flanking segments of homologous genes from both warm- and cold-blooded vertebrates. We have confirmed that, in cold-blooded vertebrates, CpG islands are often absent; when present, they have lower GC and CpG levels; the latter attain, however, statistically expected values. Finally, we have shown that CpG doublets increase with the increasing GC of exons, introns and intergenic sequences (including 'extragenic' CpG islands) in the genomes from both warm- and cold-blooded vertebrates. The correlations found are the same for both classes of vertebrates, and are similar for exons, introns and intergenic sequences (including 'extragenic' CpG islands). The findings just outlined indicate that the origin and evolution of CpG islands in the vertebrate genome are associated with compositional transitions (GC increases) in genes and isochores.},

  Abstract                 = {We have investigated the distribution of unmethylated CpG islands in vertebrate genomes fractionated according to their base composition. Genomes from warm-blooded vertebrates (man, mouse and chicken) are characterized by abundant CpG islands, whose frequency increases in DNA fractions of increasing \% of guanine + cytosine; \% G + C (GC), in parallel with the distribution of genes and CpG doublets. Small, yet significant, differences in the distribution of CpG islands were found in the three genomes. In contrast, genomes from cold-blooded vertebrates (two reptiles, one amphibian, and two fishes) were characterized by an extreme scarcity or absence of CpG islands (detected in these experiments as HpaII tiny fragments or HTF). CpG islands associated with homologous genes from cold- and warm-blooded vertebrates were then compared by analyzing CpG frequencies, GC levels, HpaII sites, rare-cutter sites and G/C boxes (GGGGCGGGGC and closely related motifs) in sequences available in gene banks. Small, yet significant, differences were again detected among the CpG islands associated with homologous genes from warm-blooded vertebrates, in that CpG islands associated with mouse or rat genes often showed low CpG and/or GC levels, as well as low numbers of HpaII sites, rare-cutter sites and G/C boxes, compared to homologous human genes; more rarely, CpG islands were just absent. As far as cold-blooded vertebrates were concerned, a number of genes showed CpG islands, which exhibited a much lower frequency of CpG doublets than that found in CpG islands of warm-blooded vertebrates, but still approached the statistically expected frequency; none of the other features of CpG islands associated with genes from warm-blooded vertebrates were present. Other genes did not show any associated CpG islands, unlike their homologues from warm-blooded vertebrates.},

We have investigated the correlations that exist between (1) the GC levels of exons of human genes, and (2) the GC levels of either intergenic sequences or introns associated with the genes under consideration. In both cases, linear relationships with slopes close to unity were found. The similarity of the linear relationships indicates similar GC levels in intergenic sequences and introns located in the same isochores. Moreover, both intergenic sequences and introns showed GC levels 5-10\% lower than the corresponding exons. The above findings considerably strengthen the previously drawn conclusion that coding and noncoding sequences (both inter- and intragenic) from the same isochores of the human genome are compositionally correlated. In addition, we find linear correlations between the GC levels of codon positions and of the intergenic sequences or introns associated with the corresponding genes, as well as among the GC levels of codon positions of genes.},

Two of these genes, both potentially involved in repair and prevention of oxidative damage, showed higher expression in queens than workers and a distinct downregulation during the ageing trajectory in workers. These were an ortholog of mammalian NTH1 and a gene encoding a fusion protein which seems to be unique for the honeybee, consisting of one domain homologous to mammalian MTH1/Nudix/bacterial mutT and another domain homologous to the mitochondrial ribosomal protein gene S23. Orthologs of aag, apn1, msh6, ogg1, smug1 and two orthologs of human ABH/E. coli alkB, had stable expression levels during the ageing trajectory except high apn1 levels in overwintering workers. To estimate eventual age-dependent mitochondrial maintenance, batches of mitochondrial DNA from young and old workers and young queens were re-sequenced using Solexa/Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The results indicate at least a 50\% reduction of intact mitochondrial fragments in foragers compared to young workers, winter bees and queens.},

  Abstract                 = {Hybridization has many and varied impacts on the process of speciation. Hybridization may slow or reverse differentiation by allowing gene flow and recombination. It may accelerate speciation via adaptive introgression or cause near-instantaneous speciation by allopolyploidization. It may have multiple effects at different stages and in different spatial contexts within a single speciation event. We offer a perspective on the context and evolutionary significance of hybridization during speciation, highlighting issues of current interest and debate. In secondary contact zones, it is uncertain if barriers to gene flow will be strengthened or broken down due to recombination and gene flow. Theory and empirical evidence suggest the latter is more likely, except within and around strongly selected genomic regions. Hybridization may contribute to speciation through the formation of new hybrid taxa, whereas introgression of a few loci may promote adaptive divergence and so facilitate speciation. Gene regulatory networks, epigenetic effects and the evolution of selfish genetic material in the genome suggest that the Dobzhansky-Muller model of hybrid incompatibilities requires a broader interpretation. Finally, although the incidence of reinforcement remains uncertain, this and other interactions in areas of sympatry may have knock-on effects on speciation both within and outside regions of hybridization.},

  Abstract                 = {A maximum-likelihood method for demographic inference is applied to data sets consisting of the frequency spectrum of unlinked single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We use simulation analyses to explore the effect of sample size and number of polymorphic sites on both the power to reject the null hypothesis of constant population size and the properties of two- and three-dimensional maximum-likelihood estimators (MLEs). Large amounts of data are required to produce accurate demographic inferences, particularly for scenarios of recent growth. Properties of the MLEs are highly dependent upon the demographic scenario, as estimates improve with a more ancient time of growth onset and smaller degree of growth. Severe episodes of growth lead to an upward bias in the estimates of the current population size, and that bias increases with the magnitude of growth. One data set of African origin supports a model of mild, ancient growth, and another is compatible with both constant population size and a variety of growth scenarios, rejecting greater than fivefold growth beginning >36,000 years ago. Analysis of a data set of European origin indicates a bottlenecked population history, with an 85\% population reduction occurring approximately 30,000 years ago.},

  Abstract                 = {One signature of adaptive radiation is a high level of trait change early during the diversification process and a plateau toward the end of the radiation. Although the study of the tempo of evolution has historically been the domain of paleontologists, recently developed phylogenetic tools allow for the rigorous examination of trait evolution in a tremendous diversity of organisms. Enemy-driven adaptive radiation was a key prediction of Ehrlich and Raven's coevolutionary hypothesis [Ehrlich PR, Raven PH (1964) Evolution 18:586-608], yet has remained largely untested. Here we examine patterns of trait evolution in 51 North American milkweed species (Asclepias), using maximum likelihood methods. We study 7 traits of the milkweeds, ranging from seed size and foliar physiological traits to defense traits (cardenolides, latex, and trichomes) previously shown to impact herbivores, including the monarch butterfly. We compare the fit of simple random-walk models of trait evolution to models that incorporate stabilizing selection (Ornstein-Ulenbeck process), as well as time-varying rates of trait evolution. Early bursts of trait evolution were implicated for 2 traits, while stabilizing selection was implicated for several others. We further modeled the relationship between trait change and species diversification while allowing rates of trait evolution to vary during the radiation. Species-rich lineages underwent a proportionately greater decline in latex and cardenolides relative to species-poor lineages, and the rate of trait change was most rapid early in the radiation. An interpretation of this result is that reduced investment in defensive traits accelerated diversification, and disproportionately so, early in the adaptive radiation of milkweeds.},

  Abstract                 = {Theory posits that selection on functionally interrelated characters will promote physical and genetic integration resulting in evolution of favourable trait-value combinations. The pygmy grasshopper Tetrix undulata (Orthoptera: Tetrigidae) displays a genetically encoded polymorphism for colour pattern. Colour morphs differ in several traits, including behaviours, thermal biology and body size. To examine if these size differences may reflect phenotypic plasticity of growth and development in response to temperature we used a split brood-design and reared hatchlings from mothers belonging to different morphs in different thermal environments (warm or cold) until maturity. We found that time to maturity was longer in the cold compared with the warm treatment. In the warm (but not in the cold) treatment time to maturity also varied among individuals born to mothers belonging to different colour morphs. Although low temperature and long development time are normally accompanied by increased body size in ectotherms, our results revealed no difference in size at maturity between individuals reared in the two temperature treatments. There was also an increase (not a decrease) in adult body size with shortened time to maturity across families within each treatment. Taken together, this suggests that body size is canalized against environmental perturbations, and that early maturation does not necessarily trade off against a size-mediated decrease in fecundity. Heritability of body size was moderate in magnitude. Moreover, body size at maturity varied among individuals belonging to different morphs and was influenced also by maternal colour morph, suggesting that a genetic correlation exists between colour pattern and body size. These findings suggest that different characters have evolved in concert and that the various colour morphs represent different evolutionary strategies, i.e., alternative peaks in a multi-modal adaptive landscape.},

  Abstract                 = {At present there is tremendous interest in characterizing the magnitude and distribution of linkage disequilibrium (LD) throughout the human genome, which will provide the necessary foundation for genome-wide LD analyses and facilitate detailed evolutionary studies. To this end, a human high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker map has been constructed. Many of the SNPs on this map, however, were identified by sampling a small number of chromosomes from a single population, and inferences drawn from studies using such SNPs may be influenced by ascertainment bias (AB). Through extensive simulations, we have found that AB is a potentially significant problem in estimating and comparing LD within and between populations. Specifically, the magnitude of AB is a function of the SNP discovery strategy, number of chromosomes used for SNP discovery, population genetic characteristics of the particular genomic region considered, amount of gene flow between populations, and demographic history of the populations. We demonstrate that a balanced SNP discovery strategy (where equal numbers of chromosomes are sampled from multiple subpopulations) is the optimal study design for generating broadly applicable SNP resources. Finally, we validate our theoretical predictions by comparing our results to publicly available data from ten genes sequenced in 24 African American and 23 European American individuals.},

More than 27,000 distinct reporter integrations in mouse embryonic stem cells, obtained with two different promoters, show ∼1,000-fold variation in expression levels. Data analysis indicates that lamina-associated domains act as attenuators of transcription, likely by reducing access of transcription factors to binding sites. Furthermore, chromatin compaction is predictive of reporter activity. We also found evidence for crosstalk between neighboring genes and estimate that enhancers can influence gene expression on average over ∼20 kb. The multiplexed reporter assay is highly flexible in design and can be modified to query a wide range of aspects of gene regulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Unisexual sperm-dependent vertebrates are of hybrid origins, rare, and predicted to be short-lived as a result of several challenges arising from their mode of reproduction. In particular, because of a lack of recombination, clonal species are predicted to have a low potential to respond to natural selection. However, many unisexual sperm-dependent species persist, and assessing the genetic diversity present in these species is fundamental to understanding how they avoid extinction. We used population genomic methods to assess genotypic variation within the unisexual fish Poecilia formosa. Measures of admixture and population differentiation, as well as clustering analyses, indicate that the genomes of individuals of P. formosa are admixed and intermediate between Poecilia latipinna and Poecilia mexicana, consistent with the hypothesis of their hybrid origins. Bayesian genomic cline analyses indicate that about 12\% of sampled loci exhibit patterns consistent with inheritance from only one parent. The estimation of observed heterozygosity clearly suggests that P. formosa is not comprised of direct descendants of a single nonrecombining asexual F1 hybrid individual. Additionally, the estimation of observed heterozygosity provides support for the hypothesis that the history of this unisexual species has included backcrossing with the parent species before the onset of gynogenesis. We also document high levels of variation among asexual individuals, which is attributable to recombination (historical or ongoing) and the accumulation of mutations. The high genetic variation suggests that this unisexual vertebrate has more potential to respond to natural selection than if they were frozen F1 hybrids.},

To address this we carried out a quantitative trait loci (QTL) study of a suite of 54 position traits describing body shapes of two threespine stickleback species: an ancestral Pacific marine form and a highly derived benthic species inhabiting a geologically young lake. About half of the 26 detected QTL affected just one coordinate and had small net effects, but several genomic regions affected multiple aspects of shape and had large net effects. The distribution of effect sizes followed the gamma distribution, as predicted by the geometric model of adaptation when detection limits are taken into account. The sex-determining chromosome region had the largest effect of any QTL. Ancestral sexual dimorphism was similar to the direction of divergence, and was largely eliminated during freshwater adaptation, suggesting that sex differences may provide variation upon which selection can act. Several shape QTL are linked to Eda, a major gene responsible for reduction of lateral body armor in freshwater. Our results are consistent with predictions of the geometric model of adaptation. Shape evolution in stickleback results from a few genes with large and possibly widespread effects and multiple genes of smaller effect.},

  Abstract                 = {The uneven distribution of species richness is a fundamental and unexplained pattern of vertebrate biodiversity. Although species richness in groups like mammals, birds, or teleost fishes is often attributed to accelerated cladogenesis, we lack a quantitative conceptual framework for identifying and comparing the exceptional changes of tempo in vertebrate evolutionary history. We develop MEDUSA, a stepwise approach based upon the Akaike information criterion for detecting multiple shifts in birth and death rates on an incompletely resolved phylogeny. We apply MEDUSA incompletely to a diversity tree summarizing both evolutionary relationships and species richness of 44 major clades of jawed vertebrates. We identify 9 major changes in the tempo of gnathostome diversification; the most significant of these lies at the base of a clade that includes most of the coral-reef associated fishes as well as cichlids and perches. Rate increases also underlie several well recognized tetrapod radiations, including most modern birds, lizards and snakes, ostariophysan fishes, and most eutherian mammals. In addition, we find that large sections of the vertebrate tree exhibit nearly equal rates of origination and extinction, providing some of the first evidence from molecular data for the importance of faunal turnover in shaping biodiversity. Together, these results reveal living vertebrate biodiversity to be the product of volatile turnover punctuated by 6 accelerations responsible for >85\% of all species as well as 3 slowdowns that have produced "living fossils." In addition, by revealing the timing of the exceptional pulses of vertebrate diversification as well as the clades that experience them, our diversity tree provides a framework for evaluating particular causal hypotheses of vertebrate radiations.},

The recent application of massively parallel sequencing methods has complemented microarray-based methods and has led to an exponential increase in the discovery of smaller structural-variation events. Some global discovery biases remain, but the integration of experimental and computational approaches is proving fruitful for accurate characterization of the copy, content and structure of variable regions. We argue that the long-term goal should be routine, cost-effective and high quality de novo assembly of human genomes to comprehensively assess all classes of structural variation.},

We compared the recent de novo assemblies using the short oligonucleotide analysis package (SOAP), generated from the genomes of a Han Chinese individual and a Yoruban individual, to experimentally validated genomic features. We found that de novo assemblies were 16.2% shorter than the reference genome and that 420.2 megabase pairs of common repeats and 99.1% of validated duplicated sequences were missing from the genome. Consequently, over 2,377 coding exons were completely missing. We conclude that high-quality sequencing approaches must be considered in conjunction with high-throughput sequencing for comparative genomics analyses and studies of genome evolution.},

Recently, new procedures inspired in systems biology criteria have started to be developed. RESULTS: Here we present FatiScan, a web-based program which implements a threshold-independent test for the functional interpretation of large-scale experiments that does not depend on the pre-selection of genes based on the multiple application of independent tests to each gene. The test implemented aims to directly test the behaviour of blocks of functionally related genes, instead of focusing on single genes. In addition, the test does not depend on the type of the data used for obtaining significance values, and consequently different types of biologically informative terms (gene ontology, pathways, functional motifs, transcription factor binding sites or regulatory sites from CisRed) can be applied to different classes of genome-scale studies. We exemplify its application in microarray gene expression, evolution and interactomics. CONCLUSION: Methods for gene set enrichment which, in addition, are independent from the original data and experimental design constitute a promising alternative for the functional profiling of genome-scale experiments.

One of its most prominent applications is the sequencing of whole genomes or targeted regions of the genome such as all exonic regions (i.e., the exome). Here, the objective is the identification of genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The extraction of SNPs from the raw genetic sequences involves many processing steps and the application of a diverse set of tools. We review the essential building blocks for a pipeline that calls SNPs from raw HTS data. The pipeline includes quality control, mapping of short reads to the reference genome, visualization and post-processing of the alignment including base quality recalibration. The final steps of the pipeline include the SNP calling procedure along with filtering of SNP candidates. The steps of this pipeline are accompanied by an analysis of a publicly available whole-exome sequencing dataset. To this end, we employ several alignment programs and SNP calling routines for highlighting the fact that the choice of the tools significantly affects the final results.},

  Abstract                 = {Genomic resources for hundreds of species of evolutionary, agricultural, economic, and medical importance are unavailable due to the expense of well-assembled genome sequences and difficulties with multigenerational studies. Teleost fish provide many models for human disease but possess anciently duplicated genomes that sometimes obfuscate connectivity. Genomic information representing a fish lineage that diverged before the teleost genome duplication (TGD) would provide an outgroup for exploring the mechanisms of evolution after whole-genome duplication. We exploited massively parallel DNA sequencing to develop meiotic maps with thrift and speed by genotyping F1 offspring of a single female and a single male spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) collected directly from nature utilizing only polymorphisms existing in these two wild individuals. Using Stacks, software that automates the calling of genotypes from polymorphisms assayed by Illumina sequencing, we constructed a map containing 8406 markers. RNA-seq on two map-cross larvae provided a reference transcriptome that identified nearly 1000 mapped protein-coding markers and allowed genome-wide analysis of conserved synteny. Results showed that the gar lineage diverged from teleosts before the TGD and its genome is organized more similarly to that of humans than teleosts. Thus, spotted gar provides a critical link between medical models in teleost fish, to which gar is biologically similar, and humans, to which gar is genomically similar. Application of our F1 dense mapping strategy to species with no prior genome information promises to facilitate comparative genomics and provide a scaffold for ordering the numerous contigs arising from next generation genome sequencing.},

  Abstract                 = {The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is central to research in molecular, cell and developmental biology, but nearly all of this research has been conducted on a single strain of C. elegans. Little is known about the population genomic and evolutionary history of this species. We characterized C. elegans genetic variation using high-throughput selective sequencing of a worldwide collection of 200 wild strains and identified 41,188 SNPs. Notably, C. elegans genome variation is dominated by a set of commonly shared haplotypes on four of its six chromosomes, each spanning many megabases. Population genetic modeling showed that this pattern was generated by chromosome-scale selective sweeps that have reduced variation worldwide; at least one of these sweeps probably occurred in the last few hundred years. These sweeps, which we hypothesize to be a result of human activity, have drastically reshaped the global C. elegans population in the recent past.},

However, the extent to which such ‚Äòdirt‚Äô DNA reflects taxonomic richness and structural diversity remains contentious. Here, we couple second generation high-throughput sequencing with 16S mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) meta-barcoding, to explore the accuracy and sensitivity of ‚Äòdirt‚Äô DNA as an indicator of vertebrate diversity, from soil sampled at safari parks, zoological gardens and farms with known species compositions. PCR amplification was successful in the full pH range of the investigated soils (6.2¬†¬±¬†0.2 to 8.3¬†¬±¬†0.2), but inhibition was detected in extracts from soil of high organic content. DNA movement (leaching) through strata was evident in some sporadic cases and is influenced by soil texture and structure. We find that DNA from the soil surface reflects overall taxonomic richness and relative biomass of individual species. However, one species that was recently introduced was not detected. Furthermore, animal behaviour was shown to influence DNA deposition rates. The approach potentially provides a quick methodological alternative to classical ecological surveys of biodiversity, and most reliable results are obtained with spatial sample replicates, while relative amounts of soil processed per site is of less importance.},

The method does not require that allele frequencies be known in the parental species nor that separate, pure samples of the parental species be available. The method is suitable for both markers with fixed allelic differences between the species and markers without fixed differences. The probability model used is one in which parentals and various classes of hybrids (F(1)'s, F(2)'s, and various backcrosses) form a mixture from which the sample is drawn. Using the framework of Bayesian model-based clustering allows us to compute, by Markov chain Monte Carlo, the posterior probability that each individual belongs to each of the distinct hybrid classes. We demonstrate the method on allozyme data from two species of hybridizing trout, as well as on two simulated data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {Within vertebrates, major sex determining genes can differ among taxa and even within species. In zebrafish (Danio rerio), neither heteromorphic sex chromosomes nor single sex determination genes of large effect, like Sry in mammals, have yet been identified. Furthermore, environmental factors can influence zebrafish sex determination. Although progress has been made in understanding zebrafish gonad differentiation (e.g. the influence of germ cells on gonad fate), the primary genetic basis of zebrafish sex determination remains poorly understood. To identify genetic loci associated with sex, we analyzed F(2) offspring of reciprocal crosses between Oregon *AB and Nadia (NA) wild-type zebrafish stocks. Genome-wide linkage analysis, using more than 5,000 sequence-based polymorphic restriction site associated (RAD-tag) markers and population genomic analysis of more than 30,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms in our *ABxNA crosses revealed a sex-associated locus on the end of the long arm of chr-4 for both cross families, and an additional locus in the middle of chr-3 in one cross family. Additional sequencing showed that two SNPs in dmrt1 previously suggested to be functional candidates for sex determination in a cross of ABxIndia wild-type zebrafish, are not associated with sex in our AB fish. Our data show that sex determination in zebrafish is polygenic and that different genes may influence sex determination in different strains or that different genes become more important under different environmental conditions. The association of the end of chr-4 with sex is remarkable because, unique in the karyotype, this chromosome arm shares features with known sex chromosomes: it is highly heterochromatic, repetitive, late replicating, and has reduced recombination. Our results reveal that chr-4 has functional and structural properties expected of a sex chromosome.},

We first describe a simple library construction protocol that uses just 10 ng of genomic DNA per individual and makes the approach accessible to any laboratory with standard molecular biology equipment. Sequencing this library results in a large number of sequence reads widely distributed across the genomes of multiplexed bar-coded individuals. We develop a Hidden Markov Model to estimate ancestry at all genomic locations in all individuals using these data. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by mapping a dominant marker allele in D. simulans to within 105 kb of its true position using 96 F1-backcross individuals genotyped in a single lane on an Illumina Genome Analyzer. We further demonstrate the utility of our method by genetically mapping more than 400 previously unassembled D. simulans contigs to linkage groups and by evaluating the quality of targeted introgression lines. At this level of multiplexing and divergence between strains, our method allows estimation of recombination breakpoints to a median of 38-kb intervals. Our analysis suggests that higher levels of multiplexing and/or use of strains with lower levels of divergence are practicable.},

  Abstract                 = {The genomics of local adaptation is an increasingly active field, providing insights into the forces driving ecological speciation and the repeatability of evolution. Demography and gene flow play an important role in determining the paths by which parallel evolution occurs and the genomic signatures of adaptation. In the annual sunflowers, hybridization between species has repeatedly led to the colonization of extreme habitats, such as sand dunes. In a new case of adaptation to sand dunes that occurs in populations of H. petiolaris growing at Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve (Colorado), we wished to determine the age and long-term migration patterns of the system, as well as its ancestry. We addressed these questions with restriction-associated DNA (RAD) sequence data, aligned to a reference transcriptome. In an isolation with migration model using RAD sequences, coalescent analysis showed that the dune ecotype originated since the last ice age, which is very recent compared with the hybrid dune species, H. anomalus. Large effective population sizes and substantial numbers of gene migrants per generation between dune and nondune ecotypes explained the highly heterogeneous divergence observed among loci. Analysis of RAD-derived SNPs identified heterogeneous divergence between the dune and nondune ecotypes, as well as identifying its nearest relative. Our results did not support the hypothesis that the dune ecotype has hybrid ancestry, suggesting that adaptation of sunflowers to dunes has occurred by multiple mechanisms. The ancestry and long-term history of gene flow between incipient sunflower species provides valuable context for our understanding of ecological speciation and parallel adaptation.},

  Abstract                 = {Early in speciation, when populations are undergoing the transition from local adaptation to incipient species, is when a number of transient, but potentially important, processes appear to be most easily detected. These include signatures of selective sweeps that can point to asymmetry in selection between habitats, divergence hitchhiking and associations of adaptive genes with environments. In a genomic comparison of ecotypes of the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris, occurring at Great Sand Dunes National Park (Colorado), we found that selective sweeps were mainly restricted to the dune ecotype and that there was variation across the genome in whether proximity to the non-dune population constrained or promoted divergence. The major regions of divergence were few and large between ecotypes, in contrast with an interspecific comparison between H. petiolaris and a sympatric congener, H. annuus. In general, the large regions of divergence observed in the ecotypic comparison swamped locus-specific associations with environmental variables. In both comparisons, regions of high divergence occurred in portions of the genetic map with high marker density, probably reflecting regions of low recombination. The difference in genomic distributions of highly divergent regions between ecotypic and interspecific comparisons highlights the value of studies spanning the spectrum of speciation in related taxa.Â© 2013 The Author(s).

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is revolutionizing the fields of population genetics, molecular ecology and conservation biology. But it can be challenging for researchers to learn the new and rapidly evolving techniques required to use NGS data. A recent workshop entitled 'Population Genomic Data Analysis' was held to provide training in conceptual and practical aspects of data production and analysis for population genomics, with an emphasis on NGS data analysis. This workshop brought together 16 instructors who were experts in the field of population genomics and 31 student participants. Instructors provided helpful and often entertaining advice regarding how to choose and use a NGS method for a given research question, and regarding critical aspects of NGS data production and analysis such as library preparation, filtering to remove sequencing errors and outlier loci, and genotype calling. In addition, instructors provided general advice about how to approach population genomics data analysis and how to build a career in science. The overarching messages of the workshop were that NGS data analysis should be approached with a keen understanding of the theoretical models underlying the analyses, and with analyses tailored to each research question and project. When analysed carefully, NGS data provide extremely powerful tools for answering crucial questions in disciplines ranging from evolution and ecology to conservation and agriculture, including questions that could not be answered prior to the development of NGS technology.},

Existing applications are difficult to use, leaving many non-trivial, error-prone tasks to the user. RESULTS: Here we present LOSITAN, a selection detection workbench based on a well evaluated Fst-outlier detection method. LOSITAN greatly facilitates correct approximation of model parameters (e.g., genome-wide average, neutral Fst), provides data import and export functions, iterative contour smoothing and generation of graphics in a easy to use graphical user interface. LOSITAN is able to use modern multi-core processor architectures by locally parallelizing fdist, reducing computation time by half in current dual core machines and with almost linear performance gains in machines with more cores. CONCLUSION: LOSITAN makes selection detection feasible to a much wider range of users, even for large population genomic datasets, by both providing an easy to use interface and essential functionality to complete the whole selection detection process.},

  Abstract                 = {The genetic architecture underlying reproductively isolating traits may have substantial impacts on the likelihood and pace of speciation. Recent studies of a key premating barrier, courtship, provide sufficient data to assess the degree to which behaviorally isolating traits are controlled by many or few loci, and help to investigate whether the same loci underlie both intraspecific and interspecific behavioral differences. Of the behavioral courtship traits examined, 69\% (25 of 36) were found to be mediated by few loci of relatively large effect. This apparent prevalence of major loci suggests that changes in courtship behavior may often evolve quickly, which in turn may drive rapid speciation through premating isolation. Although both intraspecific and interspecific courtship differences are commonly controlled by major loci, intraspecific and interspecific differences usually involve different loci or traits. This finding provides evidence that different sets of processes and genetic changes characterize microevolutionary change in courtship-related traits, in contrast to change during speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {Reduced representation genome-sequencing approaches based on restriction digestion are enabling large-scale marker generation and facilitating genomic studies in a wide range of model and nonmodel systems. However, sampling chromosomes based on restriction digestion may introduce a bias in allele frequency estimation due to polymorphisms in restriction sites. To explore the effects of this nonrandom sampling and its sensitivity to different evolutionary parameters, we developed a coalescent-simulation framework to mimic the biased recovery of chromosomes in restriction-based short-read sequencing experiments (RADseq). We analysed simulated DNA sequence datasets and compared known values from simulations with those that would be estimated using a RADseq approach from the same samples. We compare these âtrueâ and âestimatedâ values of commonly used summary statistics, Ï, Î¸w, Tajima's D and FST. We show that loci with missing haplotypes have estimated summary statistic values that can deviate dramatically from true values and are also enriched for particular genealogical histories. These biases are sensitive to nonequilibrium demography, such as bottlenecks and population expansion. In silico digests with 102 completely sequenced Drosophila melanogaster genomes yielded results similar to our findings from coalescent simulations. Though the potential of RADseq for marker discovery and trait mapping in nonmodel systems remains undisputed, our results urge caution when applying this technique to make population genetic inferences.},

  Abstract                 = {Large numbers and quantities of different, small RNA molecules are present in the cytoplasm of animal and plant cells. One subclass of these molecules is represented by the noncoding microRNAs. Since their discovery in the 1990s a multitude of basic information has accumulated, which has identified their function in post-transcriptional control, either via degradation or translational inhibition of target mRNAs. This function is in most of the cases a finetuning of gene expression, working in parallel with transcriptional regulatory processes. MicroRNA expression profiles are highly dynamic during embryonic development and in adulthood. Misexpression of microRNAs can perturb embryogenesis, organogenesis, tissue homeostasis and the cell cycle. Evidence from gain- and loss-of function studies indicates roles for microRNAs in pathophysiologic states including cardiac hypertrophy, muscle dystrophy, hepatitis infection, diabetes, Parkinson syndrome, hematological malignancies and other types of cancer. In this review, we focus on studies addressing the role of various microRNAs in heart, muscle, liver, pancreas, central nervous system, and hematopoiesis.},

Compared to the human genetic map, broad-scale recombination rates tend to be conserved, but with exceptions, particularly in regions of chromosomal rearrangements and around the site of ancestral fusion in human chromosome 2. At fine scales, chimpanzee recombination is dominated by hotspots, which show no overlap with those of humans even though rates are similarly elevated around CpG islands and decreased within genes. The hotspot-specifying protein PRDM9 shows extensive variation among Western chimpanzees, and there is little evidence that any sequence motifs are enriched in hotspots. The contrasting locations of hotspots provide a natural experiment, which demonstrates the impact of recombination on base composition.},

  Abstract                 = {Chromosome inversions have long been thought to be involved in speciation and local adaptation. We have little quantitative information, however, about the effects that inversion polymorphisms have on reproductive isolation and viability. Here we provide the first estimates from any organism for the total amount of reproductive isolation associated with an inversion segregating in natural populations. We sampled chromosomes from 751 mosquitoes of the malaria vector Anopheles funestus along a 1421 km transect in Cameroon that traverses savannah, highland, and rainforest ecological zones. We then developed a series of population genetic models that account for selection, migration, and assortative mating, and fit the models to the data using likelihood. Results from the best-fit models suggest there is strong local adaptation, with relative viabilities of homozygotes ranging from 25\% to 130\% compared to heterozygotes. Viabilities vary qualitatively between regions: the inversion is underdominant in the savannah, whereas in the highlands it is overdominant. The inversion is also implicated in strong assortative mating. In the savannah, the two homozygote forms show 92\% reproductive isolation, suggesting that this one inversion can generate most of the genetic barriers needed for speciation.},

To demonstrate that this theoretical idea works in practice, we performed an association study of 10 putative resistance variants in 471 severe malaria cases and 474 controls from the Luo in Kenya. We replicated associations at HBB (P=.0008) and CD36 (P=.03) but also showed that the same variants are unusually differentiated in frequency between the Luo and Yoruba (who historically have been exposed to malaria) and the Masai and Kikuyu (who have not been exposed). This empirically demonstrates that combining association analysis with evidence of natural selection can increase power to detect risk variants by orders of magnitude--up to P=.000018 for HBB and P=.00043 for CD36.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies of gene flow between recently diverged species can illuminate the role of natural selection in the formation of new species. Drosophila santomea and D. yakuba are recently diverged, partially reproductively isolated species that continue to hybridize in the wild, and appear to be reproductively isolated from the more distantly related species D. teissieri. We examine patterns of nucleotide polymorphism and divergence in these three species at multiple X-linked, Y-linked, and mitochondrial markers. All three species harbor drastically reduced variability on the Y chromosome relative to the X, as expected for a nonrecombining chromosome subject to variation-reducing selection. The three species are generally well differentiated at the nuclear markers, with little evidence for recent introgression for either the X- or Y-linked genes. Based on the nuclear genes, we estimate that D. santomea and D. yakuba diverged about one-half million years ago and split from D. teissieri about one million years ago. In contrast to the pattern at nuclear loci, all three species share a very similar mtDNA haplotype. We show that the mtDNA must have recently introgressed across species boundaries in the D. yakuba subgroup and that its fixation was driven by either selection on the mitochondria itself or other cytoplasmic factors. These results demonstrate that different regions of the genome can have distinct evolutionary dynamics in the context of species formation. Although natural selection is usually thought of as accentuating divergence between species, our results imply that it can also act as a homogenizing force.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding why some hybrid zones are bimodal and others unimodal can aid in identifying barriers to gene exchange following secondary contact. The hybrid zone between the grasshoppers Chorthippus brunneus and C. jacobsi contains a mix of allopatric parental populations and inter-mingled bimodal and unimodal sympatric populations, and provides an ideal system to examine the roles of local selection and gene flow between populations in maintaining bimodality. However, it is first necessary to confirm, over a larger spatial scale, previously identified associations between population composition and season and habitat. Here we use cline-fitting of one morphological and one song trait along two valley transects, and intervening mountains, to confirm previously identified habitat associations (mountain versus valley) and seasonal changes in population composition. As expected from previous findings of studies on a smaller spatial scale, C. jacobsi dominated mountain habitats and mixed populations dominated valleys, and C. brunneus became more prevalent in August. Controlling for habitat and incorporating into the analysis seasonal changes in cline parameters and the standard errors of parental trait values revealed wider clines than previous studies (best estimates of 6.4 to 24.5 km in our study versus 2.8 to 4.7 km in previous studies) and increased percentage of trait variance explained (52.7\% and 61.5\% for transects 1 and 2 respectively, versus 17.6\%). Revealing such strong and consistent patterns within a complex hybrid zone will allow more focused examination of the causes of variation in bimodality in mixed populations, in particular the roles of local selection versus habitat heterogeneity and gene flow between differentiated populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Many hybrid zones contain a deficit of hybrid genotypes relative to expectations from tension zone models. This is often associated with separation of parental genotypes into distinct habitats (mosaicism), but sometimes parentals can be found co-occuring in the same local population (bimodality). In both cases, prezygotic isolation may play an important role in determining the genotypic composition of the zone. Chorthippus brunneus and C. jacobsi (Orthoptera: Acrididae) meet and form a complex hybrid zone in northern Spain. Analysis of stridulatory peg numbers reveals partial spatial and seasonal isolation in a 25 km2 area of the zone: C. jacobsi phenotypes predominate in June and July and are present in both valley and mountain habitats; C. brunneus phenotypes predominate in August and are restricted to valley habitats, always in sympatry with C. jacobsi. Strong assortative mating was observed in laboratory mating experiments. Spatial, seasonal and behavioural isolation combine to produce strong premating isolation in the study area. These results suggest a role for premating isolation in maintaining both the mosaic structure and bimodality of this hybrid zone.},

There remains a need for a simple, inexpensive platform that allows high-density SNP discovery and genotyping in large populations. Here we describe the sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) tags, which identified more than 13,000 SNPs, and mapped three traits in two model organisms, using less than half the capacity of one Illumina sequencing run. We demonstrated that different marker densities can be attained by choice of restriction enzyme. Furthermore, we developed a barcoding system for sample multiplexing and fine mapped the genetic basis of lateral plate armor loss in threespine stickleback by identifying recombinant breakpoints in F(2) individuals. Barcoding also facilitated mapping of a second trait, a reduction of pelvic structure, by in silico re-sorting of individuals. To further demonstrate the ease of the RAD sequencing approach we identified polymorphic markers and mapped an induced mutation in Neurospora crassa. Sequencing of RAD markers is an integrated platform for SNP discovery and genotyping. This approach should be widely applicable to genetic mapping in a variety of organisms.},

  Abstract                 = {In addition to the principal B chromosome (B(1)) in Moroccan populations of the grasshopper Eyprepocnemis plorans, nine B chromosome variants appeared at low frequency. The transmission of five of these rare B chromosome variants through females was analysed in three natural populations. Sixteen controlled crosses provided useful information on the transmission of B(M2), B(M6) and B(M7) in Smir, B(M3) and B(M6) in SO.DE.A. (Société de Développement Agricole lands near Ksar-el-Kebir city), and B(M2) and B(M10) in Mechra, all located in Morocco. Since six female parents carried two different B variants, a total of 22 progeny analyses could be studied. Intraindividual variation in B transmission rate (k(B)) was observed among the successive egg pods in 26.7 \% of the females, but this variation did not show a consistent temporal pattern. Only the B(M2) and B(M6) variants in Smir showed net drive, although variation was high among crosses, especially for B(M2). These two variants are thus good candidates for future regenerations (the replacement of a neutralized B, B(1) in this case, by a new driving variant, B(M2) or B(M6)) in Smir, the northern population where the B polymorphism is presumably older. The analysis of all crosses performed in the three populations, including those reported previously for the analysis of B(1) transmission, showed that the largest variance in k(B) among crosses stands at the individual level, and not at population or type of B levels. The implications of these findings for the occurrence of possible regeneration processes in Moroccan populations are discussed.},

Likelihood methods of inference are proposed both for bi-allelic and multi-allelic loci, within a hierarchical model which allows sharing of information both across subpopulations and across loci, but without assuming constancy in either case. This framework can be used, for example, to detect environment-related diversifying selection. },

Much current forensic practice ignores, for example, the effects of coancestry and inappropriate databases and is consequently systematically biased against defendants. Problems with the 'product rule' for forensic identification have been highlighted by several authors, but important aspects of the problems are not widely appreciated. This arises in part because the match probability has often been confused with the relative frequency of the profile. Further, the analogous problems in paternity cases have received little attention. The proposed method is derived under general assumptions about the underlying population genetic processes. Probabilities relevant to forensic inference are expressed in terms of a single parameter whose values can be chosen to reflect the specific circumstances. The method is currently used in some UK courts and has important advantages over the 'Ceiling Principle' method, which has been criticized on a number of grounds.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled the sequencing of several human genomes in their entirety. However, the routine resequencing of complete genomes remains infeasible. The massive capacity of next-generation sequencers can be harnessed for sequencing specific genomic regions in hundreds to thousands of individuals. Sequencing-based association studies are currently limited by the low level of multiplexing offered by sequencing platforms. Pooled sequencing represents a cost-effective approach for studying rare variants in large populations. To utilize the power of DNA pooling, it is important to accurately identify sequence variants from pooled sequencing data. Detection of rare variants from pooled sequencing represents a different challenge than detection of variants from individual sequencing.We describe a novel statistical approach, CRISP [Comprehensive Read analysis for Identification of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from Pooled sequencing] that is able to identify both rare and common variants by using two approaches: (i) comparing the distribution of allele counts across multiple pools using contingency tables and (ii) evaluating the probability of observing multiple non-reference base calls due to sequencing errors alone. Information about the distribution of reads between the forward and reverse strands and the size of the pools is also incorporated within this framework to filter out false variants. Validation of CRISP on two separate pooled sequencing datasets generated using the Illumina Genome Analyzer demonstrates that it can detect 80-85\% of SNPs identified using individual sequencing while achieving a low false discovery rate (3-5\%). Comparison with previous methods for pooled SNP detection demonstrates the significantly lower false positive and false negative rates for CRISP.Implementation of this method is available at http://polymorphism.scripps.edu/~vbansal/software/CRISP/.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing technologies have made it possible to sequence targeted regions of the human genome in hundreds of individuals. Deep sequencing represents a powerful approach for the discovery of the complete spectrum of DNA sequence variants in functionally important genomic intervals. Current methods for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection are designed to detect SNPs from single individual sequence data sets. Here, we describe a novel method SNIP-Seq (single nucleotide polymorphism identification from population sequence data) that leverages sequence data from a population of individuals to detect SNPs and assign genotypes to individuals. To evaluate our method, we utilized sequence data from a 200-kilobase (kb) region on chromosome 9p21 of the human genome. This region was sequenced in 48 individuals (five sequenced in duplicate) using the Illumina GA platform. Using this data set, we demonstrate that our method is highly accurate for detecting variants and can filter out false SNPs that are attributable to sequencing errors. The concordance of sequencing-based genotype assignments between duplicate samples was 98.8\%. The 200-kb region was independently sequenced to a high depth of coverage using two sequence pools containing the 48 individuals. Many of the novel SNPs identified by SNIP-Seq from the individual sequencing were validated by the pooled sequencing data and were subsequently confirmed by Sanger sequencing. We estimate that SNIP-Seq achieves a low false-positive rate of approximately 2\%, improving upon the higher false-positive rate for existing methods that do not utilize population sequence data. Collectively, these results suggest that analysis of population sequencing data is a powerful approach for the accurate detection of SNPs and the assignment of genotypes to individual samples.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Similarity clustering of next-generation sequences (NGS) is an important computational problem to study the population sizes of DNA/RNA molecules and to reduce the redundancies in NGS data. Currently, most sequence clustering algorithms are limited by their speed and scalability, and thus cannot handle data with tens of millions of reads.Results: Here, we introduce SEED—an efficient algorithm for clustering very large NGS sets. It joins sequences into clusters that can differ by up to three mismatches and three overhanging residues from their virtual center. It is based on a modified spaced seed method, called block spaced seeds. Its clustering component operates on the hash tables by first identifying virtual center sequences and then finding all their neighboring sequences that meet the similarity parameters. SEED can cluster 100 million short read sequences in <4 h with a linear time and memory performance. When using SEED as a preprocessing tool on genome/transcriptome assembly data, it was able to reduce the time and memory requirements of the Velvet/Oasis assembler for the datasets used in this study by 60–85% and 21–41%, respectively. In addition, the assemblies contained longer contigs than non-preprocessed data as indicated by 12–27% larger N50 values. Compared with other clustering tools, SEED showed the best performance in generating clusters of NGS data similar to true cluster results with a 2- to 10-fold better time performance. While most of SEED's utilities fall into the preprocessing area of NGS data, our tests also demonstrate its efficiency as stand-alone tool for discovering clusters of small RNA sequences in NGS data from unsequenced organisms.Availability: The SEED software can be downloaded for free from this site: http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/seed.Contact: thomas.girke@ucr.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online},

  Abstract                 = {Improved efficacy and durability of powdery mildew resistance can be enhanced via knowledge of the genetics of resistance and susceptibility coupled with the development of high-resolution maps to facilitate the stacking of multiple resistance genes and other desirable traits. We studied the inheritance of powdery mildew (Erysiphe necator) resistance and susceptibility of wild Vitis rupestris B38 and cultivated V. vinifera 'Chardonnay', finding evidence for quantitative variation. Molecular markers were identified using genotyping-by-sequencing, resulting in 16,833 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on alignment to the V. vinifera 'PN40024' reference genome sequence. With an average density of 36 SNPs/Mbp and uniform coverage of the genome, this 17K set was used to identify 11 SNPs on chromosome 7 associated with a resistance locus from V. rupestris B38 and ten SNPs on chromosome 9 associated with a locus for susceptibility from 'Chardonnay' using single marker association and linkage disequilibrium analysis. Linkage maps for V. rupestris B38 (1,146 SNPs) and 'Chardonnay' (1,215 SNPs) were constructed and used to corroborate the 'Chardonnay' locus named Sen1 (Susceptibility to Erysiphe necator 1), providing the first insight into the genetics of susceptibility to powdery mildew from V. vinifera. The identification of markers associated with a susceptibility locus in a V. vinifera background can be used for negative selection among breeding progenies. This work improves our understanding of the nature of powdery mildew resistance in V. rupestris B38 and 'Chardonnay', while applying next-generation sequencing tools to advance grapevine genomics and breeding.},

Identifying the evolutionary forces that create hybrid incompatibility alleles is fundamental to understanding the process of speciation, but very few such alleles have been identified, particularly in model organisms that are amenable to experimental manipulation. We report here the cloning of the first, to our knowledge, Drosophila melanogaster gene involved in hybrid incompatibilities, Hybrid male rescue (Hmr). Hmr causes lethality and female sterility in hybrids among D. melanogaster and its sibling species. We have found that Hmr encodes a protein with homology to a family of MYB-related DNA-binding transcriptional regulators. The HMR protein has evolved both amino acid substitutions and insertions and deletions at an extraordinarily high rate between D. melanogaster and its sibling species, including in its predicted DNA-binding domain. Our results suggest that hybrid lethality may result from disruptions in gene regulation, and we also propose that rapid evolution may be a hallmark of speciation genes in general.},

Combining the restriction-site associated DNA strategy with high throughput sequencing has facilitated the discovery of a large number of functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers discriminating between the two eggplant mapping population parental lines '305E40' and '67/3'. A set of 347 de novo SNPs, together with 84 anchoring markers, were applied to the F(2) mapping population bred from the cross '305E40' x '67/3' to construct a linkage map. In all, 415 of the 431 markers were assembled into twelve major and one minor linkage group, spanning 1,390 cM, and the inclusion of established markers allowed each linkage group to be assigned to one of the 12 eggplant chromosomes. The map was then used to discover the genetic basis of seven traits associated with anthocyanin content. Each of the traits proved to be controlled by between one and six quantitative trait loci (QTL), of which at least one was a major QTL. Exploitation of syntenic relationships between the eggplant and tomato genomes facilitated the identification of potential candidate genes for the eggplant QTLs related to anthocyanin accumulation. The intra-specific linkage map should have utility for elucidating the genetic basis of other phenotypic traits in eggplant.},

Our study includes phylogeographic, population-genetic (based on mitochondrial DNA, microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphisms), morphometric and ecological analyses.

Here, we replicated the previous study's mapping design to examine the extent of variation at these behavioral QTLs across 6 pairs of lines, but we were unable to detect effects of either QTL region in the pairs of lines studied. We suggest that the low-discrimination alleles at these 2 QTLs may occur at low frequency within D. pseudoobscura, although other explanations for the inconsistency are possible.

  Abstract                 = {Characterizing the genetic and molecular basis of hybrid incompatibilities is a first step toward understanding their evolutionary origins. We fine mapped the nuclear restorer (Rf) of cytoplasm-dependent anther sterility in Mimulus hybrids by identifying and targeting regions of the Mimulus guttatus genome containing large numbers of candidate pentatricopeptide repeat genes (PPRs). The single Mendelian locus Rf was first isolated to a 1.3-cM region on linkage group 7 that spans the genome's largest cluster of PPRs, then split into two tightly linked loci (Rf1 and Rf2) by <10 recombination events in a large (N = 6153) fine-mapping population. Progeny testing of fertile recombinants demonstrated that a dominant M. guttatus allele at each Rf locus was sufficient to restore fertility. Each Rf locus spans a physical region containing numerous PPRs with high homology to each other, suggesting recent tandem duplication or transposition. Furthermore, these PPRs have higher homology to restorers in distantly related taxa (petunia and rice) than to PPRs elsewhere in the Mimulus genome. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS)âPPR interaction is highly conserved across flowering plants. In addition, given our theoretical understanding of cytonuclear coevolution, the finding that hybrid CMS results from interactions between a chimeric mitochondrial transcript that is modified by Rf loci identified as PPRs is consistent with a history of selfish mitochondrial evolution and compensatory nuclear coevolution within M. guttatus.},

  Abstract                 = {Current approaches to studying the evolution of biodiversity differ in their treatment of species and higher level diversity patterns. Species are regarded as the fundamental evolutionarily significant units of biodiversity, both in theory and in practice, and extensive theory explains how they originate and evolve. However, most species are still delimited using qualitative methods that only relate indirectly to the underlying theory. In contrast, higher level patterns of diversity have been subjected to rigorous quantitative study (using phylogenetics), but theory that adequately explains the observed patterns has been lacking. Most evolutionary analyses of higher level diversity patterns have considered non-equilibrium explanations based on rates of diversification (i.e. exponentially growing clades), rather than equilibrium explanations normally used at the species level and below (i.e. constant population sizes). This paper argues that species level and higher level patterns of diversity can be considered within a common framework, based on equilibrium explanations. It shows how forces normally considered in the context of speciation, namely divergent selection and geographical isolation, can generate evolutionarily significant units of diversity above the level of reproductively isolated species. Prospects for the framework to answer some unresolved questions about higher level diversity patterns are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Sexual reproduction has long been proposed as a major factor explaining the existence of species and species diversity. Yet, the importance of sex for diversification remains obscure because of a lack of critical theory, difficulties of applying universal concepts of species and speciation, and above all the scarcity of empirical tests. Here, we use genealogical theory to compare the relative tendency of strictly sexual and asexual organisms to diversify into discrete genotypic and morphological clusters. We conclude that asexuals are expected to display discrete clusters similar to those found in sexual organisms. Whether sexuals or asexuals display stronger clustering depends on a number of factors, but in at least some scenarios asexuals should display a stronger pattern. Confounding factors aside, the only explanation we identify for stronger patterns of diversification in sexuals than asexuals is if the faster rates of adaptive change conferred by sexual reproduction promote greater clustering. Quantitative comparisons of diversification in related sexual and asexual taxa are needed to resolve this issue. The answer should shed light not only on the importance of the different stages leading to diversification, but also on the adaptive consequences of sex, still largely unexplored from a macroevolutionary perspective.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary theory predicts that natural selection should be less efficient in asexually than in sexually reproducing organisms. Obligate asexuals are expected to adapt slowly to changing environments and to accumulate mildly deleterious mutations to their genomes, potentially explaining their typically short evolutionary lifespans. One group of animals that appear to challenge these ideas is the bdelloid rotifers, a large and ancient clade of obligate asexuals. Previous work has found no evidence for inefficient selection against deleterious mutations in protein-coding genes of bdelloids. However, these studies relied mostly on between-species comparisons and were therefore unable to detect mildly deleterious mutations that persist within populations but are removed by selection over longer time periods. Here, we test for inefficient purifying selection acting on the cytochrome oxidase I (cox1) mitochondrial gene in 3 clades of bdelloids. Patterns of variation are compared to those of two facultatively sexual clades: a monogonont rotifer (Brachionus) and a branchiopod crustacean (Daphnia). As predicted due to the strict linkage between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, bdelloids exhibit higher frequencies of putatively deleterious amino acid polymorphism within populations than the two facultatively sexual clades. While the monophyly and age of bdelloids makes it hard to rule out other explanations for the observed differences, several possible confounding factors, such as differences in effective population size or patterns of codon usage, are shown not to explain the observed differences. We therefore conclude that bdelloid mitochondrial DNA variation does display the signature of inefficient selection expected of obligate asexuals.},

  Abstract                 = {Why does life diversify into the more or less discrete entities we recognise as species? Two main explanations have been proposed: i) species are a consequence of adaptation to different ecological niches, ii) species are a consequence of sexual reproduction and reproductive isolation. Phylogenetic studies of case-study groups can provide insights into the relative importance of divergent selection and isolation for speciation, but it can be difficult to infer causes of speciation unambiguously. The example of North American tiger beetles from the genus Cicindela is discussed. An alternative approach is to compare diversification between related sexual and asexual taxa to infer the relative importance of the two explanations. We outline expected patterns of diversification in sexual and asexual lineages under different scenarios using coalescent theory. Whether sexuals or asexuals diversify to a greater extent depends on the balance among various stages of diversification, particularly on the effects of sexual reproduction on rates of adaptive evolution. Rotifers offer a unique system to test these ideas, allowing comparison of patterns of genetic and functional morphological diversification in sexual (bdelloid) and asexual (monogonont) clades.},

We use a densely sampled phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial DNA to investigate diversification rates in the North American tiger beetles (genus Cicindela). Using node ages estimated from sequence data and calibrated by biogeographical evidence, we estimate an average per-lineage diversification rate of at least 0.22 +/- 0.08 species/Myr over the time interval since the most recent colonization that led to a radiation within the continent. In addition, we find evidence for a weak, recent increase in the net diversification rate. This is more consistent with a late Pleistocene increase in the speciation rate than with a constant rate of background extinction, but the results are sensitive to the dating method and taxon sampling. We discuss practical limitations to phylogenetic studies of diversification rates.},

We transplanted marine sticklebacks carrying both alleles to freshwater ponds and tracked genotype frequencies over a generation. The low allele increased in frequency once lateral plates developed, most likely via a growth advantage.

The feasibility of obtaining genome sequences from experimentally evolving populations offers the opportunity to investigate this relationship with new precision. Here we sequence genomes sampled through 40,000 generations from a laboratory population of Escherichia coli. Although adaptation decelerated sharply, genomic evolution was nearly constant for 20,000 generations. Such clock-like regularity is usually viewed as the signature of neutral evolution, but several lines of evidence indicate that almost all of these mutations were beneficial. This same population later evolved an elevated mutation rate and accumulated hundreds of additional mutations dominated by a neutral signature. Thus, the coupling between genomic and adaptive evolution is complex and can be counterintuitive even in a constant environment. In particular, beneficial substitutions were surprisingly uniform over time, whereas neutral substitutions were highly variable.},

  Abstract                 = {Suppose that selection acts at one or more loci to maintain genetic differences between hybridising populations. Then, the flow of alleles at a neutral marker locus which is linked to these selected loci will be impeded. We define and calculate measures of the barrier to gene flow between two distinct demes, and across a continuous habitat. In both cases, we find that in order for gene flow to be significantly reduced over much of the genome, hybrids must be substantially less fit, and the number of genes involved in building the barrier must be so large that the majority of other genes become closely linked to some locus which is under selection. This conclusion is not greatly affected by the pattern of epistasis, or the position of the marker locus along the chromosome.},

  Abstract                 = {If distinct biological species are to coexist in sympatry, they must be reproductively isolated and must exploit different limiting resources. A two-niche Levene model is analysed, in which habitat preference and survival depend on underlying additive traits. The population genetics of preference and viability are equivalent. However, there is a linear trade-off between the chances of settling in either niche, whereas viabilities may be constrained arbitrarily. With a convex trade-off, a sexual population evolves a single generalist genotype, whereas with a concave trade-off, disruptive selection favours maximal variance. A pure habitat preference evolves to global linkage equilibrium if mating occurs in a single pool, but remarkably, evolves to pairwise linkage equilibrium within niches if mating is within those nichesâindependent of the genetics. With a concave trade-off, the population shifts sharply between a unimodal distribution with high gene flow and a bimodal distribution with strong isolation, as the underlying genetic variance increases. However, these alternative states are only simultaneously stable for a narrow parameter range. A sharp threshold is only seen if survival in the âwrongâ niche is low; otherwise, strong isolation is impossible. Gene flow from divergent demes makes speciation much easier in parapatry than in sympatry.},

  Abstract                 = {Until recently, it was impracticable to identify the genes that are responsible for variation in continuous traits, or to directly observe the effects of their different alleles. Now, the abundance of genetic markers has made it possible to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL)--the regions of a chromosome or, ideally, individual sequence variants that are responsible for trait variation. What kind of QTL do we expect to find and what can our observations of QTL tell us about how organisms evolve? The key to understanding the evolutionary significance of QTL is to understand the nature of inherited variation, not in the immediate mechanistic sense of how genes influence phenotype, but, rather, to know what evolutionary forces maintain genetic variability.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of insecticide resistance is a global constraint to agricultural production. Spinosad is a new, low-environmental-risk insecticide that primarily targets nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) and is effective against a wide range of pest species. However, after only a few years of application, field evolved resistance emerged in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, an important pest of brassica crops worldwide. Spinosad resistance in a Hawaiian population results from a single incompletely recessive and autosomal gene, and here we use AFLP linkage mapping to identify the chromosome controlling resistance in a backcross family. Recombinational mapping with more than 700 backcross progeny positioned a putative spinosad target, nAChR alpha 6 (Pxalpha6), at the resistance locus, PxSpinR. A mutation within the ninth intron splice junction of Pxalpha6 results in mis-splicing of transcripts, which produce a predicted protein truncated between the third and fourth transmembrane domains. Additional resistance-associated Pxalpha6 transcripts that excluded the mutation containing exon were detected, and these were also predicted to produce truncated proteins. Identification of the locus of resistance in this important crop pest will facilitate field monitoring of the spread of resistance and offer insights into the genetic basis of spinosad resistance in other species.},

This approach has broad potential for genetic analysis of non-model organisms including genotype-phenotype association mapping, phylogeography, population genetics and scaffolding genome assemblies through linkage mapping. We constructed a RAD library using genomic DNA from a <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> (diamondback moth) backcross that segregated for resistance to the insecticide spinosad. Sequencing of 24 individuals was performed on a single Illumina GAIIx lane (51 base paired-end reads). Taking advantage of the lack of crossing over in homologous chromosomes in female Lepidoptera, 3,177 maternally inherited RAD alleles were assigned to the 31 chromosomes, enabling identification of the spinosad resistance and W/Z sex chromosomes. Paired-end reads for each RAD allele were assembled into contigs and compared to the genome of <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (nâ=â28) using BLAST, revealing 28 homologous matches plus 3 expected fusion/breakage events which account for the difference in chromosome number. A genome-wide linkage map (1292 cM) was inferred with 2,878 segregating RAD alleles inherited from the backcross father, producing chromosome and location specific sequenced RAD markers. Here we have used RAD sequencing to construct a genetic linkage map <italic>de novo</italic> for an organism that has no previous genome data. Comparative analysis of <italic>P. xyloxtella</italic> linkage groups with <italic>B. mori</italic> chromosomes shows for the first time, genetic synteny appears common beyond the Macrolepidoptera. RAD sequencing is a powerful system capable of rapidly generating chromosome specific data for non-model organisms.</p> },

  Abstract                 = {Mimicry has had a significant historical influence as a tractable system for studying adaptation and is known to play a role in speciation. Here, we discuss recent theoretical treatment of adaptive walks to local adaptive peaks and contrast this with the adaptive landscape of mimicry. Evolution of novel Müllerian mimicry patterns almost certainly involves substitution of a major mutation to provide an initial similarity to the model, such that major gene effects are expected to an even greater degree than for other adaptive traits. The likelihood of large adaptive peak shifts in mimicry evolution may therefore promote speciation. In addition, mimicry adaptive peaks are determined by the local abundance of particular patterns and may be more fluid than the case for other traits. It will therefore be of considerable interest to test empirically the distribution of effect sizes fixed during mimicry evolution. Here, we show the feasibility of this by presenting a preliminary quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of Heliconius colour patterns. This shows that a number of modifier loci of different effect sizes influence forewing band morphology. We also show multiple pleiotropic effects of major Heliconius patterning loci and discuss the likelihood of multiple substitutions at the same loci in pattern evolution, which would inflate the importance of major loci in QTL analysis of the gene effect sizes. Analyses such as these have the potential to uncover the genetic architecture of both within and between species adaptive differences.},

  Abstract                 = {Wing patterning in Heliconius butterflies is a longstanding example of both Müllerian mimicry and phenotypic radiation under strong natural selection. The loci controlling such patterns are "hotspots" for adaptive evolution with great allelic diversity across different species in the genus. We characterise nucleotide variation, genotype-by-phenotype associations, linkage disequilibrium, and candidate gene expression at two loci and across multiple hybrid zones in Heliconius melpomene and relatives. Alleles at HmB control the presence or absence of the red forewing band, while alleles at HmYb control the yellow hindwing bar. Across HmYb two regions, separated by approximately 100 kb, show significant genotype-by-phenotype associations that are replicated across independent hybrid zones. In contrast, at HmB a single peak of association indicates the likely position of functional sites at three genes, encoding a kinesin, a G-protein coupled receptor, and an mRNA splicing factor. At both HmYb and HmB there is evidence for enhanced linkage disequilibrium (LD) between associated sites separated by up to 14 kb, suggesting that multiple sites are under selection. However, there was no evidence for reduced variation or deviations from neutrality that might indicate a recent selective sweep, consistent with these alleles being relatively old. Of the three genes showing an association with the HmB locus, the kinesin shows differences in wing disc expression between races that are replicated in the co-mimic, Heliconius erato, providing striking evidence for parallel changes in gene expression between Müllerian co-mimics. Wing patterning loci in Heliconius melpomene therefore show a haplotype structure maintained by selection, but no evidence for a recent selective sweep. The complex genetic pattern contrasts with the simple genetic basis of many adaptive traits studied previously, but may provide a better model for most adaptation in natural populations that has arisen over millions rather than tens of years.},

  Abstract                 = {We address the problem of finding evidence of natural selection from genetic data, accounting for the confounding effects of demographic history. In the absence of natural selection, gene genealogies should all be sampled from the same underlying distribution, often approximated by a coalescent model. Selection at a particular locus will lead to a modified genealogy, and this motivates a number of recent approaches for detecting the effects of natural selection in the genome as "outliers" under some models. The demographic history of a population affects the sampling distribution of genealogies, and therefore the observed genotypes and the classification of outliers. Since we cannot see genealogies directly, we have to infer them from the observed data under some model of mutation and demography. Thus the accuracy of an outlier-based approach depends to a greater or a lesser extent on the uncertainty about the demographic and mutational model. A natural modeling framework for this type of problem is provided by Bayesian hierarchical models, in which parameters, such as mutation rates and selection coefficients, are allowed to vary across loci. It has proved quite difficult computationally to implement fully probabilistic genealogical models with complex demographies, and this has motivated the development of approximations such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). In ABC the data are compressed into summary statistics, and computation of the likelihood function is replaced by simulation of data under the model. In a hierarchical setting one may be interested both in hyperparameters and parameters, and there may be very many of the latter--for example, in a genetic model, these may be parameters describing each of many loci or populations. This poses a problem for ABC in that one then requires summary statistics for each locus, which, if used naively, leads to a consequent difficulty in conditional density estimation. We develop a general method for applying ABC to Bayesian hierarchical models, and we apply it to detect microsatellite loci influenced by local selection. We demonstrate using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis that this approach has comparable performance to a full-likelihood method and outperforms it when mutation rates are variable across loci.},

For example, based on gene sequence and microsatellite data, the method has been used to choose between competing models of human demographic history as well as to infer growth rates, times of divergence, and other parameters. The method fits naturally in the Bayesian inferential framework, and a brief overview is given of the key concepts. Three main approaches to ABC have been developed, and these are described and compared. Although the method arose in population genetics, ABC is increasingly used in other fields, including epidemiology, systems biology, ecology, and agent-based modeling, and many of these applications are briefly described. },

  Abstract                 = {A useful way of summarizing genetic variability among different populations is through estimates of the inbreeding coefficient, F(st). Several recent studies have tried to use the distribution of estimates of F(st) from individual genetic loci to detect the effects of natural selection. However, the promise of this approach has yet to be fully realized owing to the pervasive dogma that this distribution is highly dependent on demographic history. Here, I review recent theoretical results that indicate that the distribution of estimates of F(st) is generally expected to be robust to the vagaries of demographic history. I suggest that analyses based on it provide a useful first step for identifying candidate genes that might be under selection, and explore the ways in which this information can be used in ecological and evolutionary studies.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new method for approximate Bayesian statistical inference on the basis of summary statistics. The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

  Abstract                 = {How often do the early stages of speciation occur in the presence of gene flow? To address this enduring question, a number of recent papers have used computational approaches, estimating parameters of simple divergence models from multilocus polymorphism data collected in closely related species. Applications to a variety of species have yielded extensive evidence for migration, with the results interpreted as supporting the widespread occurrence of parapatric speciation. Here, we conduct a simulation study to assess the reliability of such inferences, using a program that we recently developed MCMC estimation of the isolation-migration model allowing for recombination (MIMAR) as well as the program isolation-migration (IM) of Hey and Nielsen (2004). We find that when one of many assumptions of the isolation-migration model is violated, the methods tend to yield biased estimates of the parameters, potentially lending spurious support for allopatric or parapatric divergence. More generally, our results highlight the difficulty in drawing inferences about modes of speciation from the existing computational approaches alone.},

  Abstract                 = {How populations diverge and give rise to distinct species remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology, with important implications for a wide range of fields, from conservation genetics to human evolution. A promising approach is to estimate parameters of simple speciation models using polymorphism data from multiple loci. Existing methods, however, make a number of assumptions that severely limit their applicability, notably, no gene flow after the populations split and no intralocus recombination. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate parameters of an isolation-migration model. The approach uses summaries of polymorphism data at multiple loci surveyed in a pair of diverging populations or closely related species and, importantly, allows for intralocus recombination. To illustrate its potential, we applied it to extensive polymorphism data from populations and species of apes, whose demographic histories are largely unknown. The isolation-migration model appears to provide a reasonable fit to the data. It suggests that the two chimpanzee species became reproductively isolated in allopatry approximately 850 Kya, while Western and Central chimpanzee populations split approximately 440 Kya but continued to exchange migrants. Similarly, Eastern and Western gorillas and Sumatran and Bornean orangutans appear to have experienced gene flow since their splits approximately 90 and over 250 Kya, respectively.},

While debate continues about how to get the most out of these studies and on occasion about how much value these studies really provide, it is clear that many of the strongest results have come from large-scale mega-consortia and/or meta-analyses that combine data from up to dozens of studies and tens of thousands of subjects. While such analyses are becoming more and more common, statistical methods have lagged somewhat behind. There are good meta-analysis methods available, but even when they are carefully and optimally applied there remain some unresolved statistical issues. This article systematically reviews the GWAS meta-analysis literature, highlighting methodology and software options and reviewing methods that have been used in real studies. We illustrate differences among methods using a case study. We also discuss some of the unresolved issues and potential future directions.},

We discovered previously unknown, large-scale fluctuations of polymorphism and divergence along chromosome arms, and significantly less polymorphism and faster divergence on the X chromosome. We generated a comprehensive list of functional elements in the D. simulans genome influenced by adaptive evolution. Finally, we characterized genomic patterns of base composition for coding and noncoding sequence. These results suggest several new hypotheses regarding the genetic and biological mechanisms controlling polymorphism and divergence across the Drosophila genome, and provide a rich resource for the investigation of adaptive evolution and functional variation in D. simulans.},

  Abstract                 = {The small regulatory non-coding RNA molecules, known as microRNAs, have been recognized as potential regulator(s) of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In Drosophila melanogaster, microRNAs have been identified that control important developmental processes such as apoptosis, cell division, Notch signaling, neural development and oogenesis, among others. Once activated through a step-wise maturation process, a microRNA can potentially regulate more than 50 target genes temporally and spatially in Drosophila. Thus, it is of tremendous importance to understand how these small RNA molecules have evolved and how they are expressed and regulated to impact cellular function and the associated evolutionary fitness. Studies of microRNAs in diverse insect species using the genome sequences (at least 49 insect genome sequences are in progress) may provide important clues to better understand the natural selection of microRNA genes in particular and their impact on biological functions in insects in general.},

Hybridization between the subspecies Cp erythropus and Cp parallelus, previously only known from populations in the Pyrenean cols, is shown to extend at least 400 km further into north-west Spain. A novel X-chromosome variant is described that appears to be close to fixation in 18 populations, mainly from the centre and south of Spain. Our findings indicate a possible independent origin for each of three distinct, nonderivative X variants present in Spain: the northern Cp erythropus and Cp parallelus variants, and a central-southern Cp erythropus variant. The first two are distinguished by interstitial and distal C bands, respectively, whereas the central-southern form has neither. This central-southern form is probably the current representative of the ancestral Iberian X variant. The pattern of variation supports the hypotheses of multiple refugia for Iberian populations and that more hybrid zones exist between these chromosomal variants.},

  Abstract                 = {n birds, as in mammals, one pair of chromosomes differs between the sexes. In birds, males are ZZ and females ZW. In mammals, males are XY and females XX. Like the mammalian XY pair, the avian ZW pair is believed to have evolved from autosomes, with most change occurring in the chromosomes found in only one sex?the W and Y chromosomes1, 2, 3, 4, 5. By contrast, the sex chromosomes found in both sexes?the Z and X chromosomes?are assumed to have diverged little from their autosomal progenitors2. Here we report findings that challenge this assumption for both the chicken Z chromosome and the human X chromosome. The chicken Z chromosome, which we sequenced essentially to completion, is less gene-dense than chicken autosomes but contains a massive tandem array containing hundreds of duplicated genes expressed in testes. A comprehensive comparison of the chicken Z chromosome with the finished sequence of the human X chromosome demonstrates that each evolved independently from different portions of the ancestral genome. Despite this independence, the chicken Z and human X chromosomes share features that distinguish them from autosomes: the acquisition and amplification of testis-expressed genes, and a low gene density resulting from an expansion of intergenic regions. These features were not present on the autosomes from which the Z and X chromosomes originated but were instead acquired during the evolution of Z and X as sex chromosomes. We conclude that the avian Z and mammalian X chromosomes followed convergent evolutionary trajectories, despite their evolving with opposite (female versus male) systems of heterogamety. More broadly, in birds and mammals, sex chromosome evolution involved not only gene loss in sex-specific chromosomes, but also marked expansion and gene acquisition in sex chromosomes common to males and females.},

  Abstract                 = {The screening of many endpoints when comparing groups from different strains, searching for some statistically significant difference, raises the multiple comparisons problem in its most severe form. Using the 0.05 level to decide which of the many endpoints' differences are statistically significant, the probability of finding a difference to be significant even though it is not real increases far beyond 0.05. The traditional approach to this problem has been to control the probability of making even one such error--the Bonferroni procedure being the most familiar procedure achieving such control. However, the incurred loss of power stemming from such control led many practitioners to neglect multiplicity control altogether. The False Discovery Rate (FDR), suggested by Benjamini and Hochberg [J Royal Stat Soc Ser B 57 (1995) 289], is a new, different, and compromising point of view regarding the error in multiple comparisons. The FDR is the expected proportion of false discoveries among the discoveries, and controlling the FDR goes a long way towards controlling the increased error from multiplicity while losing less in the ability to discover real differences. In this paper we demonstrate the problem in two studies: the study of exploratory behavior [Behav Brain Res (2001)], and the study of the interaction of strain differences with laboratory environment [Science 284 (1999) 1670]. We explain the FDR criterion, and present two simple procedures that control the FDR. We demonstrate their increased power when used in the above two studies.},

Podisma pedestris, the brown mountain grasshopper, has a genome over 100 times as large as that of Drosophila and 10 times as large as that of Laupala. We used 58 paralogous nuclear pseudogenes of mitochondrial origin to study the characteristics of insertion, deletion, and point substitution in P. pedestris and Italopodisma. In animals, these pseudogenes are "dead on arrival"; they are abundant in many different eukaryotes, and their mitochondrial origin simplifies the identification of point substitutions accumulated in nuclear pseudogene lineages. There appears to be a mononucleotide repeat within the 643-bp pseudogene sequence studied that acts as a strong hot spot for insertions or deletions (indels). Because the data for other insect species did not contain such an unusual region, hot spots were excluded from species comparisons. The rate of DNA loss relative to point substitution appears to be considerably and significantly lower in the grasshoppers studied than in Drosophila or Laupala. This suggests that the inverse correlation between genome size and the rate of DNA loss can be extended to comparisons between insects with large or gigantic genomes (i.e., Laupala and Podisma). The low rate of DNA loss implies that in grasshoppers, the accumulation of point mutations is a more potent force for obscuring ancient pseudogenes than their loss through indel accumulation, whereas the reverse is true for Drosophila. The main factor contributing to the difference in the rates of DNA loss estimated for grasshoppers, crickets, and Drosophila appears to be deletion size. Large deletions are relatively rare in Podisma and Italopodisma.},

Since the last review of these nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (Numts) in animals, Numts have been found in 53 of the species studied. The recent evidence suggests that Numts are not equally abundant in all species, for example they are more common in plants than in animals, and also more numerous in humans than in Drosophila. Methods for avoiding Numts have now been tested, and several recent studies demonstrate the potential utility of Numt DNA sequences in evolutionary studies. As relics of ancient mtDNA, these pseudogenes can be used to infer ancestral states or root mitochondrial phylogenies. Where they are numerous and selectively unconstrained, Numts are ideal for the study of spontaneous mutation in nuclear genomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiple copies of mitochondrial-like DNA were found in the brown mountain grasshopper, Podisma pedestris (Orthoptera: Acrididae), paralogous to COI and ND5 regions. The same was discovered using the ND5 regions of nine other grasshopper species from four separate subfamilies (Podisminae, Calliptaminae, Crytacanthacridinae, and Gomphocerinae). The extra ND5-like sequences were shown to be nuclear in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria (Cyrtacanthacridinae), and probably so in P. pedestris and an Italopodisma sp. (Podisminae), Eighty-seven different ND5-like nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (Numts) were sequenced from 12 grasshopper individuals. Different nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes, if descended from the same mitochondrial immigrant, will have diverged from each other under no selective constraints because of their loss of functionality. Evidence of selective constraints in the differences between any two Numt sequences (e.g., if most differences are at third positions of codons) implies that they have separate mitochondrial origins. Through pairwise comparisons of pseudogene sequences, it was established that there have been at least 12 separate mtDNA integrations into P. pedestris nuclear genomes. This is the highest reported rate of horizontal transfer between organellar and nuclear genomes within a single animal species. The occurrence of numerous mitochondrial pseudogenes in nuclear genomes derived from separate integration events appears to be a common phenomenon among grasshoppers. More than one type of mechanism appears to have been involved in generating the observed grasshopper Numts. },

  Abstract                 = {DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from >30x average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications.},

The identification of sequence polymorphisms in the Drosophila genome will make it possible to map mutations directly to the genome sequence with high accuracy and resolution. Here we report the identification of 7,223 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1,392 insertions/deletions (InDels) in common laboratory strains of Drosophila. These sequence polymorphisms define a map of 787 autosomal marker loci with a resolution of 114 kb. We have established PCR product-length polymorphism (PLP) or restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) assays for 215 of these markers. We demonstrate the use of this map by delimiting two mutations to intervals of 169 kb and 307 kb, respectively. Using a local high-density SNP map, we also mapped a third mutation to a resolution of approximately 2 kb, sufficient to localize the mutation within a single gene. These methods should accelerate the rate of positional cloning in Drosophila.},

Integrating MHAP with the Celera Assembler enabled reference-grade de novo assemblies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster and a human hydatidiform mole cell line (CHM1) from SMRT sequencing. The resulting assemblies are highly continuous, include fully resolved chromosome arms and close persistent gaps in these reference genomes. Our assembly of D. melanogaster revealed previously unknown heterochromatic and telomeric transition sequences, and we assembled low-complexity sequences from CHM1 that fill gaps in the human GRCh38 reference. Using MHAP and the Celera Assembler, single-molecule sequencing can produce de novo near-complete eukaryotic assemblies that are 99.99% accurate when compared with available reference genomes.},

In this paper, we review the main findings of a long-term research programme that we have been conducting on the ecological genomics of sympatric forms of whitefish (Coregonus spp.) engaged in the process of speciation. We present this system as an example of how applying a combination of approaches under the conceptual framework of the theory of adaptive radiation has yielded substantial insight into evolutionary processes in a non-model species. We also discuss how the joint use of recent biotechnological developments will provide a powerful means to address issues raised by observations made to date. Namely, we present data illustrating the potential offered by combining next generation sequencing technologies with other genomic approaches to reveal the genomic bases of adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation. Given increasing access to these new genomic tools, we argue that non-model species studied in their ecological context such as whitefish will play an increasingly important role in generalizing knowledge of speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {We study levels of X-linked vs. autosomal diversity using a model developed to analyze the hitchhiking effect. Repeated bouts of hitchhiking are thought to lower X-linked diversity for two reasons: first, because sojourn times of beneficial mutations are shorter on the X, and second, because adaptive substitutions may be more frequent on the X. We investigate whether each of these effects does, in fact, cause reduced X-linked diversity under hitchhiking. We study the strength of the hitchhiking effect on the X vs. autosomes when there is no recombination and under two different recombination schemes. When recombination occurs in both sexes, X-linked vs. autosomal diversity is reduced by hitchhiking under a broad range of conditions, but when there is no recombination in males, as in Drosophila, the required conditions are considerably more restrictive.},

  Abstract                 = {The genetic structure and dynamics of hybrid zones provide crucial information for understanding the processes and mechanisms of evolutionary divergence and speciation. In general, higher levels of evolutionary divergence between taxa are more likely to be associated with reproductive isolation and may result in suppressed or strongly restricted hybridization. In this study, we examined two secondary contact zones between three deep evolutionary lineages in the common vole (Microtus arvalis). Differences in divergence times between the lineages can shed light on different stages of reproductive isolation and thus provide information on the ongoing speciation process in M.Â arvalis. We examined more than 800 individuals for mitochondrial (mtDNA), Y-chromosome and autosomal markers and used assignment and cline analysis methods to characterize the extent and direction of gene flow in the contact zones. Introgression of both autosomal and mtDNA markers in a relatively broad area of admixture indicates selectively neutral hybridization between the least-divergent lineages (Central and Eastern) without evidence for partial reproductive isolation. In contrast, a very narrow area of hybridization, shifts in marker clines and the quasi-absence of Y-chromosome introgression support a moving hybrid zone and unidirectional selection against male hybrids between the lineages with older divergence (Central and Western). Data from a replicate transect further support non-neutral processes in this hybrid zone and also suggest a role for landscape history in the movement and shaping of geneflow profiles.},

  Abstract                 = {In a pair of seminal papers, Sewall Wright and Gustave Malécot introduced FST as a measure of structure in natural populations. In the decades that followed, a number of papers provided differing definitions, estimation methods, and interpretations beyond Wright's. While this diversity in methods has enabled many studies in genetics, it has also introduced confusion regarding how to estimate FST from available data. Considering this confusion, wide variation in published estimates of FST for pairs of HapMap populations is a cause for concern. These estimates changed—in some cases more than twofold—when comparing estimates from genotyping arrays to those from sequence data. Indeed, changes in FST from sequencing data might be expected due to population genetic factors affecting rare variants. While rare variants do influence the result, we show that this is largely through differences in estimation methods. Correcting for this yields estimates of FST that are much more concordant between sequence and genotype data. These differences relate to three specific issues: (1) estimating FST for a single SNP, (2) combining estimates of FST across multiple SNPs, and (3) selecting the set of SNPs used in the computation. Changes in each of these aspects of estimation may result in FST estimates that are highly divergent from one another. Here, we clarify these issues and propose solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {Natural history museum collections provide unique resources for understanding how species respond to environmental change, including the abrupt, anthropogenic climate change of the past century. Ideally, researchers would conduct genome-scale screening of museum specimens to explore the evolutionary consequences of environmental changes, but to date such analyses have been severely limited by the numerous challenges of working with the highly degraded DNA typical of historic samples. Here, we circumvent these challenges by using custom, multiplexed, exon capture to enrich and sequence ~11¬†000 exons (~4¬†Mb) from early 20th-century museum skins. We used this approach to test for changes in genomic diversity accompanying a climate-related range retraction in the alpine chipmunks (Tamias alpinus) in the high Sierra Nevada area of California, USA. We developed robust bioinformatic pipelines that rigorously detect and filter out base misincorporations in DNA derived from skins, most of which likely resulted from postmortem damage. Furthermore, to accommodate genotyping uncertainties associated with low-medium coverage data, we applied a recently developed probabilistic method to call single-nucleotide polymorphisms and estimate allele frequencies and the joint site frequency spectrum. Our results show increased genetic subdivision following range retraction, but no change in overall genetic diversity at either nonsynonymous or synonymous sites. This case study showcases the advantages of integrating emerging genomic and statistical tools in museum collection-based population genomic applications. Such technical advances greatly enhance the value of museum collections, even where a pre-existing reference is lacking and points to a broad range of potential applications in evolutionary and conservation biology.},

  Abstract                 = {Loci with higher levels of population differentiation than the neutral expectation are traditionally interpreted as evidence of ongoing selection that varies in space. This article emphasizes an alternative explanation that has been largely overlooked to date: in species subdivided into large subpopulations, enhanced differentiation can also be the signature left by the fixation of an unconditionally favorable mutation on its chromosomal neighborhood. This is because the hitchhiking effect is expected to diminish as the favorable mutation spreads from the deme in which it originated to other demes. To discriminate among the two alternative scenarios one needs to investigate how genetic structure varies along the chromosomal region of the locus. Local hitchhiking is shown to generate a single sharp peak of differentiation centered on the adaptive polymorphism and the standard signature of a selective sweep only in those subpopulations in which the allele is favored. Global hitchhiking produces two domes of differentiation on either side of the fixed advantageous mutation and signatures of a selective sweep in every subpopulation, albeit of different magnitude. Investigating population differentiation around a locus that strongly differentiates two otherwise genetically similar populations of the marine mussel Mytilus edulis, plausible evidence for the global hitchhiking hypothesis has been obtained. Global hitchhiking is a neglected phenomenon that might prove to be important in species with large population sizes such as many marine invertebrates.},

  Abstract                 = {It is now common for population geneticists to estimate FST for a large number of loci across the genome, before testing for selected loci as being outliers to the FST distribution. One surprising result of such FST scans is the often high proportion (>1\% and sometimes >10\%) of outliers detected, and this is often interpreted as evidence for pervasive local adaptation. In this issue of Molecular Ecolog, Fourcade et al. (2013) observe that a particularly high rate of FST outliers has often been found in river organisms, such as fishes or damselflies, despite there being no obvious reason why selection should affect a larger proportion of the genomes of these organisms. Using computer simulations, Fourcade et al. (2013) show that the strong correlation in co-ancestry produced in long onedimensional landscapes (such as rivers, valleys, peninsulas, oceanic ridges or coastlines) greatly increases the neutral variance in FST, especially when the landscape is further reticulated into fractal networks. As a consequence, outlier tests have a high rate of false positives, unless this correlation can be taken into account. Fourcade et al.'s study highlights an extreme case of the general problem, first noticed by Robertson (1975a,b) and Nei & Maruyama (1975), that correlated co-ancestry inflates the neutral variance in FST when compared to its expectation under an island model of population structure. Similar warnings about the validity of outlier tests have appeared regularly since then but have not been widely cited in the recent genomics literature. We further emphasize that FST outliers can arise in many different ways and that outlier tests are not designed for situations where the genetic architecture of local adaptation involves many loci.},

  Abstract                 = {Genomic scans of multiple populations often reveal marker loci with greatly increased differentiation between populations. Often this differentiation coincides in space with contrasts in ecological factors, forming a genetic-environment association (GEA). GEAs imply a role for local adaptation, and so it is tempting to conclude that the strongly differentiated markers are themselves under ecologically based divergent selection, or are closely linked to loci under such selection. Here, we highlight an alternative and neglected explanation: intrinsic (i.e. environment-independent) pre- or post-zygotic genetic incompatibilities rather than local adaptation can be responsible for increased differentiation. Intrinsic genetic incompatibilities create endogenous barriers to gene flow, also known as tension zones, whose location can shift over time. However, tension zones have a tendency to become trapped by, and therefore to coincide with, exogenous barriers due to ecological selection. This coupling of endogenous and exogenous barriers can occur easily in spatially subdivided populations, even if the loci involved are unlinked. The result is that local adaptation explains where genetic breaks are positioned, but not necessarily their existence, which can be best explained by endogenous incompatibilities. More precisely, we show that (i) the coupling of endogenous and exogenous barriers can easily occur even when ecological selection is weak; (ii) when environmental heterogeneity is fine-grained, GEAs can emerge at incompatibility loci, but only locally, in places where habitats and gene pools are sufficiently intermingled to maintain linkage disequilibria between genetic incompatibilities, local-adaptation genes and neutral loci. Furthermore, the association between the locally adapted and intrinsically incompatible alleles (i.e. the sign of linkage disequilibrium between endogenous and exogenous loci) is arbitrary and can form in either direction. Reviewing results from the literature, we find that many predictions of our model are supported, including endogenous genetic barriers that coincide with environmental boundaries, local GEA in mosaic hybrid zones, and inverted or modified GEAs at distant locations. We argue that endogenous genetic barriers are often more likely than local adaptation to explain the majority of Fst-outlying loci observed in genome scan approaches - even when these are correlated to environmental variables.},

  Abstract                 = {The advantage of sex has been among the most debated issues in biology. Surprisingly, the question of why sexual reproduction generally requires the combination of distinct gamete classes, such as small and large gametes, or gametes with different mating types, has been much less investigated. Why do systems with alternative gamete classes (i.e. systems with either anisogamy or mating types or both) appear even though they restrict the probability of finding a compatible mating partner? Why does the number of gamete classes vary from zero to thousands, with most often only two classes? We review here the hypotheses proposed to explain the origin, maintenance, number, and loss of gamete classes. We argue that fungi represent highly suitable models to help resolve issues related to the evolution of distinct gamete classes, because the number of mating types vary from zero to thousands across taxa, anisogamy is present or not, and because there are frequent transitions between these conditions. We review the nature and number of gamete classes in fungi, and we attempt to draw inferences from these data on the evolutionary forces responsible for their appearance, loss or maintenance, and number.},

Samples are individually radiocarbon dated or are assigned ages via age models fitted to sequences of calibrated radiocarbon dates within a section. Tree species characteristic of modern northern forests (e.g. Picea, Larix, tree-Betula) are recorded at least intermittently from prior to the last glacial maximum (LGM), through the \{LGM\} and Lateglacial, to the Holocene, and some records locate trees close to the limits of the Scandinavian ice sheet, supporting the hypothesis that some taxa persisted in northern refugia during the last glacial cycle. Northern trees show differing spatio-temporal patterns across Siberia: deciduous trees were widespread in the Lateglacial, with individuals occurring across much of their contemporary ranges, while evergreen conifers expanded northwards to their range limits in the Holocene. },

  Abstract                 = {When an advantageous mutation is fixed in a population by selection, a closely linked selectively neutral or mildly detrimental mutation may "hitchhike" to fixation along with it. It has been suggested that hitchhiking might increase the rate of molecular evolution. Computer simulations and a mathematical argument show that complete linkage to either advantageous or deleterious mutations does not affect the substitution of selectively neutral mutations. However, the simulations show that linkage to selected background mutations decreases the rate of fixation of advantageous mutations and increases the rate of fixation of detrimental mutations. This is true whether the linked background mutations are advantageous or detrimental, and it verifies and extends previous observations that linkage tends to reduce the effects of selection on evolution. These results can be interpreted in terms of the Hill-Robertson effect: a locus linked to another locus under selection experiences a reduction in effective population size. The interpretation of differences in evolutionary rates between different genomes or different regions of a genome may be confounded by the effects of strong linkage and selection. Recombination is expected to reduce the overall rate of molecular evolution while enhancing the rate of adaptive evolution.},

The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of Class I and Class II microsatellites in a collection of over 21,000 ESTs from a single study of five different tissues of common bean: two types of leaves, nodules, pods and roots. For this objective, we used three different bioinformatics pipelines: Automated Microsatellite Marker Development (AMMD), Batchprimer3 and SSRLocator. In addition, we determined the frequency of single or multiple SSRs in the assembled ESTs, the frequency of perfect and compound repeats and whether Class I microsatellites were mainly di-nucleotide or tri-nucleotide motifs with each of the search engines. Primers were designed for a total of 175 microsatellites concentrating on class I microsatellites identified with SSR locator. A few other microsatellites were included from the other search engines, AMMD and Batchprimer3 programs so as to have a representative set of class II markers for comparison sake. The comparison of 95 class I vs. 80 class II markers confirmed that the Class I were more polymorphic and therefore more useful.},

It is now clear that a genome defense system of RNA-mediated silencing also plays a crucial role in limiting TE proliferation. A full understanding of TE evolutionary dynamics must consider how these forces jointly determine their proliferation within genomes. Here I consider these forces from two perspectives â dynamics within populations and evolutionary games within the germline. The analysis of TE dynamics from these two perspectives promises to provide new insight into their role in evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila is a syndrome of gonadal atrophy, sterility, and male recombination, and it occurs in the progeny of crosses between males that harbor certain transposable elements (TEs) and females that lack them. Known examples of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster result from mobilization of individual families of TEs, such as the P element, the I element, or hobo. An example of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis is unique in that multiple, unrelated families of TEs become mobilized, but a TE designated Penelope appears to play a major role. In all known examples of hybrid dysgenesis, the paternal germ line transmits the TEs in an active state, whereas the female germ line maintains repression of the TEs. The mechanism of maternal maintenance of repression is not known. Recent evidence suggests that the molecular machinery of RNA interference may function as an important host defense against TEs. This protection is mediated by the action of endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) composed of dsRNA molecules of 21-25 nt that can target complementary transcripts for destruction. In this paper, we demonstrate that endogenous siRNA derived from the Penelope element is maternally loaded in embryos through the female germ line in D. virilis. We also present evidence that the maternal inheritance of these endogenous siRNAs may contribute to maternal repression of Penelope.},

  Abstract                 = {The persistence of asexual reproduction in many taxa depends on a balance between the origin of new asexual lineages and the extinction of old ones. This turnover determines the diversity of extant asexual populations and so influences the interaction between sexual and asexual modes of reproduction. Species with mixed reproduction, like the freshwater ostracod (Crustacea) morphospecies Eucypris virens, are a good model to examine these dynamics. This species is also a geographic parthenogen, in which sexual females and males co-exist with asexual females in the circum-Mediterranean area only, whereas asexual females occur all over Europe. A molecular phylogeny of E. virens based on the mitochondrial COI and 16S fragments is presented. It is characterised by many distinct clusters of haplotypes which are either exclusively sexual or asexual, with only one exception, and are often separated by deep branches. Analysis of the phylogeny reveals an astonishing cryptic diversity, which indicates the existence of a species complex with more than 40 cryptic taxa. We therefore suggest a revision of the single species status of E. virens. The phylogeny indicates multiple transitions from diverse sexual ancestor populations to asexuality. Although many transitions appear to be ancient, we argue that this may be an artefact of the existence of unsampled or extinct sexual lineages.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to its cost effectiveness, next generation sequencing of pools of individuals (Pool-Seq) is becoming a popular strategy for genome-wide estimation of allele frequencies in population samples. As the allele frequency spectrum provides information about past episodes of selection, Pool-seq is also a promising design for genomic scans for selection. However, no software tool has yet been developed for selection scans based on Pool-Seq data. We introduce Pool-hmm, a Python program for the estimation of allele frequencies and the detection of selective sweeps in a Pool-Seq sample. Pool-hmm includes several options that allow a flexible analysis of Pool-Seq data, and can be run in parallel on several processors.

This paper shows that a familiar model of sympatric speciation, driven by intraspecific competition and assortative mating based on ecological characters values, can yield multiple daughter species if individual niche widths are sufficiently restricted. Surprisingly, the multi-species outcome is not produced by successive bifurcation events, but by simultaneous divergence resulting in a hard polytomy. This result is sensitive to a number of assumptions, whose violation may prevent speciation. In some cases when speciation fails, the population instead ends in a state that closely resembles incipient species pairs, with an ecological polymorphism and partial reproductive isolation. However, this polymorphism is stable and does not lead to complete reproductive isolation, suggesting that empirical cases of incipient species pairs may not always end in speciation.},

This paper investigates two such assumptions: that genetic variation for stringent assortative mating is not limiting and that females are not penalized for mating assortatively. Simulations demonstrate that the speed of sympatric speciation is very sensitive to the population's capacity for stringent assortative mating and is potentially extremely slow. The rapid divergence often thought to be a hallmark of sympatric speciation may only occur in a restricted area of parameter space.},

  Abstract                 = {Theory suggests that frequency-dependent resource competition will disproportionately impact the most common phenotypes in a population. The resulting disruptive selection forms the driving force behind evolutionary models of niche diversification, character release, ecological sexual dimorphism, resource polymorphism, and sympatric speciation. However, there is little empirical support for the idea that intraspecific competition generates disruptive selection. This paper presents a test of this theory, using natural populations of the three-spine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. Sticklebacks exhibit substantial individual specialization associated with phenotypic variation and so are likely to experience frequency-dependent competition and hence disruptive selection. Using body size and relative gonad mass as indirect measures of potential fecundity and hence fitness, I show that an important aspect of trophic morphology, gill raker length, is subject to disruptive selection in one of two natural lake populations. To test whether this apparent disruptive selection could have been caused by competition, I manipulated population densities in pairs of large enclosures in each of five lakes. In each lake I removed fish from one enclosure and added them to the other to create paired low- and high-population-density treatments with natural phenotype distributions. Again using indirect measures of fitness, disruptive selection was consistently stronger in high-density than low-density enclosures. These results support long-standing theoretical arguments that intraspecific competition drives disruptive selection and thus may be an important causal agent in the evolution of ecological variation.},

  Abstract                 = { Sympatric speciation, the evolution of reproductive isolation without geographic barriers, remains highly contentious. As a result of new empirical examples and theory, it is now generally accepted that sympatric speciation has occurred in at least a few instances, and is theoretically plausible. Instead, debate has shifted to whether sympatric speciation is common, and whether modelsâ assumptions are generally met in nature. The relative frequency of sympatric speciation will be difficult to resolve, because biogeographic changes have obscured geographical patterns underlying many past speciation events. In contrast, progress is being made on evaluating the empirical validity of key theoretical conditions for sympatric speciation. Disruptive selection and direct selection on mating traits, which should facilitate sympatric speciation, are biologically well supported. Conversely, costs to assortative mating are also widely documented, but inhibit speciation. Evaluating the joint incidence of these key factors may illuminate why sympatric speciation appears to be relatively uncommon. },

  Abstract                 = {Disruptive selection is often assumed to be relatively rare, because it is dynamically unstable and hence should be transient. However, frequency-dependent interactions such as intraspecific competition may stabilize fitness minima and make disruptive selection more common. Such selection helps explain the maintenance of genetic variation and may even contribute to sympatric speciation. There is thus great interest in determining when and where disruptive selection is most likely. Here, we show that there is a general trend toward weak disruptive selection on trophic morphology in three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in 14 lakes on Vancouver Island. Selection is inferred from the observation that, within a lake, fish with intermediate gill raker morphology exhibited slower growth than phenotypically extreme individuals. Such selection has previously been shown to arise from intraspecific competition for alternate resources. However, not all environments are equally conducive to disruptive selection, which was strongest in intermediate-sized lakes where both littoral and pelagic prey are roughly balanced. Also, consistent with theory, we find that sexual dimorphism in trophic traits tends to mitigate disruptive selection. These results suggest that it may be possible to anticipate the kinds of environments and populations most likely to experience disruptive selection.},

  Abstract                 = {In socially monogamous species, individuals can use extra-pair paternity and offspring sex allocation as adaptive strategies to ameliorate costs of genetic incompatibility with their partner. Previous studies on domesticated Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae) demonstrated a genetic incompatibility between head colour morphs, the effects of which are more severe in female offspring. Domesticated females use differential sex allocation, and extra-pair paternity with males of compatible head colour, to reduce fitness costs associated with incompatibility in mixed-morph pairings. However, laboratory studies are an oversimplification of the complex ecological factors experienced in the wild and may only reflect the biology of a domesticated species. This study aimed to examine the patterns of parentage and sex ratio bias with respect to colour pairing combinations in a wild population of the Gouldian finch. We utilized a novel PCR assay that allowed us to genotype the morph of offspring before the morph phenotype develops and to explore bias in morph paternity and selection at the nest. Contrary to previous findings in the laboratory, we found no effect of pairing combinations on patterns of extra-pair paternity, offspring sex ratio or selection on morphs in nestlings. In the wild, the effect of morph incompatibility is likely much smaller, or absent, than was observed in the domesticated birds. Furthermore, the previously studied domesticated population is genetically differentiated from the wild population, consistent with the effects of domestication. It is possible that the domestication process fostered the emergence (or enhancement) of incompatibility between colour morphs previously demonstrated in the laboratory.},

Some of the answers will probably come from not only studying incompatibilities between well-established species, but also from investigating incipient speciation events, to learn more about speciation as an evolutionary process. The genus Arabidopsis, which includes the widely used Arabidopsis thaliana, provides a useful set of model species for studying many aspects of population divergence. The genus contains both self-incompatible and incompatible species, providing a platform for studying the impact of mating system changes on genetic differentiation. Another important path to plant speciation is via formation of polyploids, and this can be investigated in the young allotetraploid species A. arenosa. Finally, there are many cases of intraspecific incompatibilities in A. thaliana, and recent progress has been made in discovering the genes underlying both F-1 and F-2 breakdown. In the near future, all these studies will be greatly empowered by complete genome sequences not only for all members of this relatively small genus, but also for many different individuals within each species.},

  Abstract                 = {The refutation of 'soft' inheritance and establishment of Mendelian genetics as the exclusive model of heredity is widely portrayed as an iconic success story of scientific progress. Yet, we are witnessing a re-emergence of debate on the role of soft inheritance in heredity and evolution. I argue that this reversal reflects not only the weight of new evidence but also an important conceptual change. I show that the concept of soft inheritance rejected by 20th-century genetics differs fundamentally from the current concept of 'nongenetic inheritance'. Moreover, whereas it has long been assumed that heredity is mediated by a single, universal mechanism, a pluralistic model of heredity is now emerging, based on a recognition of multiple, parallel mechanisms of inheritance.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecological diversification presents an enduring puzzle: how do novel ecological strategies evolve in organisms that are already adapted to their ecological niche? Most attempts to answer this question posit a primary role for genetic drift, which could carry populations through or around fitness "valleys" representing maladaptive intermediate phenotypes between alternative niches. Sexual selection and conflict are thought to play an ancillary role by initiating reproductive isolation and thereby facilitating divergence in ecological traits through genetic drift or local adaptation. Here, I synthesize theory and evidence suggesting that sexual selection and conflict could play a more central role in the evolution and diversification of ecological strategies through the co-optation of sexual traits for viability-related functions. This hypothesis rests on three main premises, all of which are supported by theory and consistent with the available evidence. First, sexual selection and conflict often act at cross-purposes to viability selection, thereby displacing populations from the local viability optimum. Second, sexual traits can serve as preadaptations for novel viability-related functions. Third, ancestrally sex-limited sexual traits can be transferred between sexes. Consequently, by allowing populations to explore a broad phenotypic space around the current viability optimum, sexual selection and conflict could act as powerful drivers of ecological adaptation and diversification.},

  Abstract                 = {In species where males provide neither direct benefits nor paternal care, it is typically assumed that female preferences are maintained by indirect selection reflecting genetic benefits to offspring of preferred males. However, it remains unclear whether populations harbour sufficient genetic variation in fitness to support costly female preferences - a problem called the 'lek paradox'. Here, we ask whether indirect selection on female preferences can be maintained by nongenetic inheritance. We construct a general model that can be used to represent either genetic or nongenetic inheritance, depending on the choice of parameter values. Interestingly, we find that costly preference is most likely to evolve and persist when fitness depends on an environmentally induced factor that can be transmitted over a single generation only, such as an environment-dependent paternal effect. Costly preference can also be supported when fitness depends on a highly mutable factor that can persist over multiple generations, such as an epigenetic mark, but the necessary conditions are more restrictive. Our findings show that nongenetic inheritance provides a plausible hypothesis for the maintenance of costly female preferences in species where males provide no direct benefits to females. Nongenetic paternal inheritance of fitness can occur in species lacking conventional forms of paternal care. Indeed, transmission of paternal condition via sperm-borne nongenetic factors may be more likely to evolve than conventional forms of paternal investment because sperm-borne effects are protected from cuckoldry. Our results furnish a novel example of an interaction between genetic and nongenetic inheritance that can lead to otherwise unexpected evolutionary outcomes.},

The products of these genes, along with RNAs and proteins imported from the cytoplasm, endow mitochondria with their own systems for DNA replication, transcription, mRNA processing and translation of proteins. The study of these genomes as they function in mitochondrial systems-'mitochondrial genomics'-serves as a model for genome evolution. Furthermore, the comparison of animal mitochondrial gene arrangements has become a very powerful means for inferring ancient evolutionary relationships, since rearrangements appear to be unique, generally rare events that are unlikely to arise independently in separate evolutionary lineages. Complete mitochondrial gene arrangements have been published for 58 chordate species and 29 non-chordate species, and partial arrangements for hundreds of other taxa. This review compares and summarizes these gene arrangements and points out some of the questions that may be addressed by comparing mitochondrial systems.},

Although "whole"-genome sequences, such as those now available for 12 Drosophila species, provide information about euchromatic DNA content, they cannot give an accurate estimate of genome sizes that include heterochromatin or repetitive DNA content. Moreover, genome sequences typically represent only one strain or isolate of a single species that does not reflect intraspecies variation. To more accurately estimate whole-genome DNA content and compare these estimates to newly assembled genomes, we used flow cytometry to measure the 2C genome values, relative to Drosophila melanogaster. We estimated genome sizes for the 12 sequenced Drosophila species as well as 91 different strains of 38 species of Drosophilidae. Significant differences in intra- and interspecific 2C genome values exist within the Drosophilidae. Furthermore, by measuring polyploid 16C ovarian follicle cell underreplication we estimated the amount of satellite DNA in each of these species. We found a strong correlation between genome size and amount of satellite underreplication. Addition and loss of heterochromatin satellite repeat elements appear to have made major contributions to the large differences in genome size observed in the Drosophilidae.},

  Abstract                 = {The occurrence of a fish-specific genome duplication (FSGD) in the lineage leading to teleost fishes is widely accepted, but the consequences of this event remain elusive. Teleosts, and the cichlid fishes from the species flocks in the East African Great Lakes in particular, evolved a unique complexity and diversity of body coloration and color patterning. Several genes involved in pigment cell development have been retained in duplicate copies in the teleost genome after the FSGD. Here we investigate the evolutionary fate of one of these genes, the type III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (csf1r). We isolated and shotgun sequenced two paralogous csf1r genes from a bacterial artificial chromosome library of the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni that are both linked to paralogs of the pdgfr beta gene, another type III RTK. Two pdgfr beta-csf1r paralogons were also identified in the genomes of pufferfishes and medaka, and our phylogenetic analyses suggest that the pdgfr beta-csf1r locus was duplicated during the course of the FSGD. Comparisons of teleosts and tetrapods suggest asymmetrical divergence at different levels of genomic organization between the teleost-specific pdgfr beta-csf1r paralogons, which seem to have evolved as coevolutionary units. The high-evolutionary rate in the teleost B-paralogon, consisting of csf1rb and pdgfr betab, further suggests neofunctionalization by functional divergence of the extracellular, ligand-binding region of these cell-surface receptors. Finally, we hypothesize that genome duplications and the associated expansion of the RTK family might be causally linked to the evolution of coloration in vertebrates and teleost fishes in particular.},

The focus then turns to identifying regions of âmajorâ effect, overlooking the observation that traits of ecological or evolutionary relevance usually involve many genes whose individual effects are small but whose cumulative effect is large. Herein, we use the power of fully interfertile natural populations of a single species of mosquito to develop three quantitative trait loci (QTL) maps: one between two post-glacially diverged populations and two between a more ancient and a post-glacial population. All demonstrate that photoperiodic response is genetically a highly complex trait. Furthermore, we show that marker regressions identify apparently ânon-significantâ regions of the genome not identified by composite interval mapping, that the perception of the genetic basis of adaptive evolution is crucially dependent upon genetic background and that the genetic basis for adaptive evolution of photoperiodic response is highly variable within contemporary populations as well as between anciently diverged populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Shallow marine benthic communities around Antarctica show high levels of endemism, gigantism, slow growth, longevity and late maturity, as well as adaptive radiations that have generated considerable biodiversity in some taxa. The deeper parts of the Southern Ocean exhibit some unique environmental features, including a very deep continental shelf and a weakly stratified water column, and are the source for much of the deep water in the world ocean. These features suggest that deep-sea faunas around the Antarctic may be related both to adjacent shelf communities and to those in other oceans. Unlike shallow-water Antarctic benthic communities, however, little is known about life in this vast deep-sea region. Here, we report new data from recent sampling expeditions in the deep Weddell Sea and adjacent areas (748-6,348 m water depth) that reveal high levels of new biodiversity; for example, 674 isopods species, of which 585 were new to science. Bathymetric and biogeographic trends varied between taxa. In groups such as the isopods and polychaetes, slope assemblages included species that have invaded from the shelf. In other taxa, the shelf and slope assemblages were more distinct. Abyssal faunas tended to have stronger links to other oceans, particularly the Atlantic, but mainly in taxa with good dispersal capabilities, such as the Foraminifera. The isopods, ostracods and nematodes, which are poor dispersers, include many species currently known only from the Southern Ocean. Our findings challenge suggestions that deep-sea diversity is depressed in the Southern Ocean and provide a basis for exploring the evolutionary significance of the varied biogeographic patterns observed in this remote environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Functional connectivity between spatially disjoint habitat patches is a key factor for the persistence of species in fragmented landscapes. Modelling landscape connectivity to identify potential dispersal corridors requires information about those landscape features affecting dispersal. Here we present a new approach using spatial and genetic data of a highly fragmented population of capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) in the Black Forest, Germany, to investigate effects of landscape structure on gene flow and to parameterize a spatially explicit corridor model for conservation purposes. Mantel tests and multiple regressions on distance matrices were employed to detect and quantify the effect of different landscape features on relatedness among individuals, while controlling for the effect of geographic distance. We extrapolated the results to an area-wide landscape permeability map and developed a new corridor model that incorporates stochasticity in simulating animal movement. The model was evaluated using both a partition of the data previously set apart and independent observation data of dispersing birds. Most land cover variables (such as coniferous forest, forest edges, agricultural land, roads, settlements) and one topographic variable (topographic exposure) were significantly correlated with gene flow. Although inter-individual relatedness inherently varies greatly and the variance explained by geographic distance and landscape structure was low, the permeability map and the corridor model significantly explained relatedness in the validation data and the spatial distribution of dispersing birds. Thus, landscape structure measurably affected within-population gene flow in the study area. By converting these effects into spatially explicit information our model enables localizing priority areas for the preservation or restoration of metapopulation connectivity.},

  Abstract                 = {The level of DNA sequence variation is reduced in regions of the Drosophila melanogaster genome where the rate of crossing over per physical distance is also reduced. This observation has been interpreted as support for the simple model of genetic hitchhiking, in which directional selection on rare variants, e.g., newly arising advantageous mutants, sweeps linked neutral alleles to fixation, thus eliminating polymorphisms near the selected site. However, the frequency spectra of segregating sites of several loci from some populations exhibiting reduced levels of nucleotide diversity and reduced numbers of segregating sites did not appear different from what would be expected under a neutral equilibrium model. Specifically, a skew toward an excess of rare sites was not observed in these samples, as measured by Tajima's D. Because this skew was predicted by a simple hitchhiking model, yet it had never been expressed quantitatively and compared directly to DNA polymorphism data, this paper investigates the hitchhiking effect on the site frequency spectrum, as measured by Tajima's D and several other statistics, using a computer simulation model based on the coalescent process and recurrent hitchhiking events. The results presented here demonstrate that under the simple hitchhiking model (1) the expected value of Tajima's D is large and negative (indicating a skew toward rare variants), (2) that Tajima's test has reasonable power to detect a skew in the frequency spectrum for parameters comparable to those from actual data sets, and (3) that the Tajima's Ds observed in several data sets are very unlikely to have been the result of simple hitchhiking. Consequently, the simple hitchhiking model is not a sufficient explanation for the DNA polymorphism at those loci exhibiting a decreased number of segregating sites yet not exhibiting a skew in the frequency spectrum.},

These species are readily distinguished by the number of stridulatory pegs on the hind femur. Both sexes are fully winged and inhabit disturbed habitats throughout the study area. We develop a maximum-likelihood approach to fitting a two-dimensional cline to geographical variation in quantitative traits and for estimating associations of population mean with local habitat. This method reveals a cline in peg number approximately 30 km south of the Picos de Europa Mountains that shows substantial deviations in population mean compared with the expectations of simple tension zone models. The inclusion of variation in local vegetation in the model explains a significant proportion of the residual variation in peg number, indicating that habitat-genotype associations contribute to the observed spatial pattern. However, this association is weak, and a number of populations continue to show strong deviations in mean even after habitat is included in the final model. These outliers may be the result of long-distance colonization of sites distant from the cline center or may be due to a patchy pattern of initial contact during postglacial expansion. As well as contrasting with the smooth hybrid zones described for Chorthippus parallelus, this situation also contrasts with the mosaic hybrid zones observed in Gryllus crickets and in parts of the hybrid zone between Bombina toad species, where habitat-genotype associations account for substantial amounts of among-site variation.},

In this paper, we fit a two-dimensional cline to variation in male calling song characters, which are of particular interest as they are likely to be involved in mate choice by females. As with variation in peg number, local habitat makes only a small contribution in explaining deviations in mean song score from clinal expectations. However, the fitted width of the cline for song characters is significantly narrower than for peg number, suggesting that mating signals may be associated with reduced hybrid fitness in the field and that recombination rates are sufficient to allow clines for different characters to diverge in width. Despite this, estimates for the overall elevation in linkage disequilibrium at the zone center, based on covariance between peg and song characters, reveal a substantial overrepresentation of parental genotypes at the cline center relative to the expectations of a tension zone of similar width. Examination of covariance at individual sites reveals that this inflated estimate of linkage disequilibrium is caused by several sites where the distribution of phenotypes is effectively bimodal. This substantial variation in linkage disequilibrium at the cline center could result from local variation in the strength of assortative mating or selection against hybrids, or may reflect the long-distance colonization of empty habitat from outside the hybrid zone, which would continually create new contacts between parental genotypes at the cline center. Hybrid zones like this, in which strong linkage disequilibrium occurs in some situations but not in others, are of particular relevance to speciation research and allow investigation of the spread of combinations of alleles through different genetic and ecological backgrounds.},

Analysis of colour pattern variation identifies a total of 21 distinct Operational Taxonomic Units in Sulawesi, the majority of which have parapatric distributions. Patterns of phenotypic variation at two contact zones in north Sulawesi suggest genetic independence between three of these colour forms, indicating that speciation has occurred. Despite this, colour pattern divergence is only coincident with morphological differentiation at one of these contact zones. In addition, neither type of phenotypic divergence is associated with geographical structuring in mitochondrial DNA, suggesting that historical isolation has had little influence on evolutionary diversification. Instead, divergence in colour pattern and morphology appears to have occurred rapidly or under conditions of continued gene now, possibly in response to spatially variable natural selection. This result has implications for the identification of conservation units based solely on molecular markers. (C) 2001 The Linnean Society of London. },

However, in contrast to other Chorthippus taxa that form hybrid zones in Europe, these two species cannot be reliably distinguished on the basis of characteristics of the karyotype such as heterochromatin banding patterns and composition, as revealed by C-banding and fluorochrome staining. Silver staining also reveals the presence of two autosomal nucleolar organiser regions (NORs) in both species. However, differentiation between C. brunneus and C. jacobsi was revealed on the X chromosome using fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). C. brunneus individuals showed additional rDNA sequences on the X chromosome that were not observed in any C. jacobsi individuals.

We present a method of targeted ancient DNA sequence retrieval that greatly reduces sample destruction and sequencing demands and use this method to reconstruct the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes of five Neandertals from across their geographic range. We find that mtDNA genetic diversity in Neandertals that lived 38,000 to 70,000 years ago was approximately one-third of that in contemporary modern humans. Together with analyses of mtDNA protein evolution, these data suggest that the long-term effective population size of Neandertals was smaller than that of modern humans and extant great apes.},

We show that purines are overrepresented at positions adjacent to the breaks in the ancient DNA, suggesting that depurination has contributed to its degradation. We furthermore show that substitutions resulting from miscoding cytosine residues are vastly overrepresented in the DNA sequences and drastically clustered in the ends of the molecules, whereas other substitutions are rare. We present a model where the observed substitution patterns are used to estimate the rate of deamination of cytosine residues in single- and double-stranded portions of the DNA, the length of single-stranded ends, and the frequency of nicks. The results suggest that reliable genome sequences can be obtained from Pleistocene organisms.},

Polymorphism detection is a key application. We describe general methods for improved quality scores and accurate automated polymorphism detection, and apply them to data from the Roche (454) Genome Sequencer 20. We assess our methods using known-truth data sets, which is critical to the validity of the assessments. We developed informative, base-by-base error predictors for this sequencer and used a variant of the phred binning algorithm to combine them into a single empirically derived quality score. These quality scores are more useful than those produced by the system software: They both better predict actual error rates and identify many more high-quality bases. We developed a SNP detection method, with variants for low coverage, high coverage, and PCR amplicon applications, and evaluated it on known-truth data sets. We demonstrate good specificity in single reads, and excellent specificity (no false positives in 215 kb of genome) in high-coverage data.},

We present a new method and software for inference of haplotype phase and missing data that can accurately phase data from whole-genome association studies, and we present the first comparison of haplotype-inference methods for real and simulated data sets with thousands of genotyped individuals. We find that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of both speed and accuracy for large data sets with thousands of individuals and densely spaced genetic markers, and we use our method to phase a real data set of 3,002 individuals genotyped for 490,032 markers in 3.1 days of computing time, with 99\% of masked alleles imputed correctly.

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, the explosion of affordable next generation sequencing technology has provided an unprecedented opportunity to conduct genome-wide studies of adaptive evolution in organisms previously lacking extensive genomic resources. Here, we characterize genome-wide patterns of variability and differentiation using pooled DNA from eight populations of the nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius L.) from marine, lake and pond environments. We developed a novel genome complexity reduction protocol, defined as paired-end double restriction-site-associated DNA (PE dRAD), to maximize read coverage at sequenced locations. This allowed us to identify over 114Â 000 short consensus sequences and 15Â 000 SNPs throughout the genome. A total of 6834 SNPs mapped to a single position on the related three-spined stickleback genome, allowing the detection of genomic regions affected by divergent and balancing selection, both between species and between freshwater and marine populations of the nine-spined stickleback. Gene ontology analysis revealed 15 genomic regions with elevated diversity, enriched for genes involved in functions including immunity, chemical stimulus response, lipid metabolism and signalling pathways. Comparisons of marine and freshwater populations identified nine regions with elevated differentiation related to kidney development, immunity and MAP kinase pathways. In addition, our analysis revealed that a large proportion of the identified SNPs mapping to LG XII is likely to represent alternative alleles from divergent X and Y chromosomes, rather than true autosomal markers following Mendelian segregation. Our work demonstrates how population-wide sequencing and combining inter- and intra-specific RAD analysis can uncover genome-wide patterns of differentiation and adaptations in a non-model species.},

  Abstract                 = {Allelic chromosomal regions totaling more than 2.8 Mb and located on maize (Zea mays) chromosomes 1L, 2S, 7L, and 9S have been sequenced and compared over distances of 100 to 350 kb between the two maize inbred lines Mo17 and B73. The alleles contain extended regions of nonhomology. On average, more than 50\% of the compared sequence is noncolinear, mainly because of the insertion of large numbers of long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons. Only 27 LTR-retroelements are shared between alleles, whereas 62 are allele specific. The insertion of LTR-retrotransposons into the maize genome is statistically more recent for nonshared than shared ones. Most surprisingly, more than one-third of the genes (27/72) are absent in one of the inbreds at the loci examined. Such nonshared genes usually appear to be truncated and form clusters in which they are oriented in the same direction. However, the nonshared genome segments are gene-poor, relative to regions shared by both inbreds, with up to 12-fold difference in gene density. By contrast, miniature inverted terminal repeats (MITEs) occur at a similar frequency in the shared and nonshared fractions. Many times, MITES are present in an identical position in both LTRs of a retroelement, indicating that their insertion occurred before the replication of the retroelement in question. Maize ESTs and/or maize massively parallel signature sequencing tags were identified for the majority of the nonshared genes or homologs of them. In contrast with shared genes, which are usually conserved in gene order and location relative to rice (Oryza sativa), nonshared genes violate the maize colinearity with rice. Based on this, insertion by a yet unknown mechanism, rather than deletion events, seems to be the origin of the nonshared genes. The intergenic space between conserved genes is enlarged up to sixfold in maize compared with rice. Frequently, retroelement insertions create a different sequence environment adjacent to conserved genes.},

  Abstract                 = {Two subspecies of the grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus form a hybrid zone in the Pyrenees. Transitions across the zone, including changes in mating signals and reproductive isolation have been intensively studied. Cuticular pheromones have been identified as likely mate recognition signals. Since the major role of the cuticle is in waterproofing, environmental adaptation of cuticular composition has the interesting potential to generate assortative mating as an incidental by-product. We describe the pattern of variation in cuticular hydrocarbon blend in four transects through the hybrid zone. We find no evidence for a previously observed displaced cline in one blend component. There were differences between subspecies but these varied among transects and were small compared with variation between transects. We examined environmental variation within one transect and found a correlation between vegetation and cuticular composition, suggesting that environment influences the constitution of the cuticle, and hence natural selection may interact with mating signals in this species.  © 2003 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2003, 78, 1932212201.},

  Abstract                 = {Research in molecular ecology is now often based on large numbers of DNA sequence reads. Given a time and financial budget for DNA sequencing, the question arises as to how to allocate the finite number of sequence reads among three dimensions: (i) sequencing individual nucleotide positions repeatedly and achieving high confidence in the true genotype of individuals, (ii) sampling larger numbers of individuals from a population, and (iii) sampling a larger fraction of the genome. Leaving aside the question of what fraction of the genome to sample, we analyze the trade-off between repeatedly sequencing the same nucleotide position (coverage depth) and the number of individuals in the sample. We review simple Bayesian models for allele frequencies and utilize these in the analysis of how to obtain maximal information about population genetic parameters. The models indicate that sampling larger numbers of individuals, at the expense of coverage depth per nucleotide position, provides more information about population parameters. Dividing the sequencing effort maximally among individuals and obtaining approximately one read per locus and individual (1{\^{A}}{~}{\~{A}}{\^{A}}{~}coverage) yields the most information about a population. Some analyses require genetic parameters for individuals, in which case Bayesian population models also support inference from lower coverage sequence data than are required for simple likelihood models. Low coverage sequencing is not only sufficient to support inference, but it is optimal to design studies to utilize low coverage because they will yield highly accurate and precise parameter estimates based on more individuals or sites in the genome.},

  Abstract                 = {A key objective of population genomics is to identify portions of the genome that have been shaped by natural selection rather than by neutral divergence. A previously recognized but underappreciated challenge to this objective is that observations of allele frequencies across genomes in natural populations often correspond to a single, unreplicated instance of the outcome of evolution. This is because the composition of each individual genomic region and population is expected to be the outcome of a unique array of evolutionary processes. Given a single observation, inference of the evolutionary processes that led to the observed state of a locus is associated with considerable uncertainty. This constraint on inference can be ameliorated by utilizing multi-allelic (e.g. DNA haplotypes) rather than bi-allelic markers, by analysing two or more populations with certain models and by utilizing studies of replicated experimental evolution. Future progress in population genomics will follow from research that recognizes the 'n = 1 constraint' and that utilizes appropriate and explicit evolutionary models for analysis.},

Admixture mapping falls within a family of statistical approaches that use natural recombination and linkage disequilibrium between genetic markers and phenotypes as the basis for mapping. Our aim in this review is to provide a snapshot of previous and ongoing research, existing methods and challenges, the nature of questions that can be investigated and prospects for the future of admixture mapping.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimental evolution systems allow the genomic study of adaptation, and so far this has been done primarily in asexual systems with small genomes, such as bacteria and yeast. Here we present whole-genome resequencing data from Drosophila melanogaster populations that have experienced over 600 generations of laboratory selection for accelerated development. Flies in these selected populations develop from egg to adult ∼20\% faster than flies of ancestral control populations, and have evolved a number of other correlated phenotypes. On the basis of 688,520 intermediate-frequency, high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms, we identify several dozen genomic regions that show strong allele frequency differentiation between a pooled sample of five replicate populations selected for accelerated development and pooled controls. On the basis of resequencing data from a single replicate population with accelerated development, as well as single nucleotide polymorphism data from individual flies from each replicate population, we infer little allele frequency differentiation between replicate populations within a selection treatment. Signatures of selection are qualitatively different than what has been observed in asexual species; in our sexual populations, adaptation is not associated with 'classic' sweeps whereby newly arising, unconditionally advantageous mutations become fixed. More parsimonious explanations include 'incomplete' sweep models, in which mutations have not had enough time to fix, and 'soft' sweep models, in which selection acts on pre-existing, common genetic variants. We conclude that, at least for life history characters such as development time, unconditionally advantageous alleles rarely arise, are associated with small net fitness gains or cannot fix because selection coefficients change over time.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolution in allopatric populations can lead to incompatibilities that result in reduced hybrid fitness and ultimately reproductive isolation upon secondary contact. The DobzhanskyâMuller (DM) model nicely accounts for the evolution of such incompatibilities. Although DM incompatibilities were originally conceived as resulting of interactions between nuclear genes, recent studies have documented cases where incompatibilities have arisen between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA). Although mtDNA comprises only a tiny component (typically âª0.01%) of an organism's genetic material, several features of mtDNA may lead to a disproportionate contribution to the evolution of hybrid incompatibilities: (i) essentially all functions of mtDNA require interaction with nuclear gene products. All mtDNA-encoded proteins are components of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system and all mtDNA-encoded RNAs are part of the mitochondrial protein synthetic machinery; both processes require interaction with nuclear-encoded proteins for function. (ii) Transcription and replication of mtDNA also involve mitonuclear interactions as nuclear-encoded proteins must bind to regulatory motifs in the mtDNA to initiate these processes. (iii) Although features of mtDNA vary amongst taxa, metazoan mtDNA is typically characterized by high nucleotide substitution rates, lack of recombination and reduced effective population sizes that collectively lead to increased chance fixation of mildly deleterious mutations. Combined, these features create an evolutionary dynamic where rapid mtDNA evolution favours compensatory nuclear gene evolution, ultimately leading to co-adaptation of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. When previously isolated lineages hybridize in nature or in the lab, intergenomic co-adaptation is disrupted and hybrid breakdown is observed; the role of intergenomic co-adaptation in hybrid breakdown and speciation will generally be most pronounced when rates of mtDNA evolution are high or when restricted gene flow results in significant population differentiation.},

  Abstract                 = {The complex genome of rapeseed (Brassica napus) is not well understood despite the economic importance of the species. Good knowledge of sequence variation is needed for genetics approaches and breeding purposes. We used a diversity set of B. napus representing eight different germplasm types to sequence genome-wide distributed restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) fragments for polymorphism detection and genotyping.More than 113,000 RAD clusters with more than 20,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 125 insertions/deletions were detected and characterized. About one third of the RAD clusters and polymorphisms mapped to the Brassica rapa reference sequence. An even distribution of RAD clusters and polymorphisms was observed across the B. rapa chromosomes, which suggests that there might be an equal distribution over the Brassica oleracea chromosomes, too. The representation of Gene Ontology (GO) terms for unigenes with RAD clusters and polymorphisms revealed no signature of selection with respect to the distribution of polymorphisms within genes belonging to a specific GO category.Considering the decreasing costs for next-generation sequencing, the results of our study suggest that RAD sequencing is not only a simple and cost-effective method for high-density polymorphism detection but also an alternative to SNP genotyping from transcriptome sequencing or SNP arrays, even for species with complex genomes such as B. napus.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>Microsatellites are popular genetic markers in molecular ecology, genetic mapping and forensics. Unfortunately, despite recent advances, the isolation of de novo polymorphic microsatellite loci often requires expensive and intensive groundwork. Primers developed for a focal species are commonly tested in a related, non-focal species of interest for the amplification of orthologous polymorphic loci; when successful, this approach significantly reduces cost and time of microsatellite development. However, transferability of polymorphic microsatellite loci decreases rapidly with increasing evolutionary distance, and this approach has shown its limits. Whole genome sequences represent an under-exploited resource to develop cross-species primers for microsatellites. Here we describe a three-step method that combines a novel in silico pipeline that we use to (1) identify conserved microsatellite loci from a multiple genome alignments, (2) design degenerate primer pairs, with (3) a simple PCR protocol used to implement these primers across species. Using this approach we developed a set of primers for the mammalian clade. We found 126,306 human microsatellites conserved in mammalian aligned sequences, and isolated 5,596 loci using criteria based on wide conservation. From a random subset of â¼1000 dinucleotide repeats, we designed degenerate primer pairs for 19 loci, of which five produced polymorphic fragments in up to 18 mammalian species, including the distinctly related marsupials and monotremes, groups that diverged from other mammals 120â160 million years ago. Using our method, many more cross-clade microsatellite loci can be harvested from the currently available genomic data, and this ability is set to improve exponentially as further genomes are sequenced.</p>},

Rates of speciation were estimated by considering the number of living species in each genus and the fossil record of each genus as well as information about extinction rates. Speciation rate was strongly correlated with rate of chromosomal evolution and average rates of speciation in lower vertebrate genera were one-fifth those in mammalian genera. Genera with high karyotypic diversity and rapid speciation rates may generally have small effective population size (Ne), whereas large Ne values may be associated with karyotypically uniform genera and slow rates of speciation. Speciation and chromosomal evolution seem fastest in those genera with species organized into clans or harems (e.g., some primates and horses) or with limited adult vagility and juvenile dispersal, patchy distribution, and strong individual territoriality (e.g., some rodents). This is consistent with the above hypothesis regarding the evolutionary importance of demes.},

The barrier then spreads until reproductive isolation influences the whole genome. The population genomics approach can be used to identify regions of reduced gene flow by detecting loci with greater differentiation than expected from the average across many loci. Recently, this approach has been used in several systems. I review these studies, concentrating on the robustness of the approach and the methods available to go beyond the simple identification of differentiated markers. Population genomics has already contributed significantly to understanding the balance between gene flow and selection during the evolution of reproductive isolation and has great future potential both in genome species and in non-model organisms.},

I argue that ideas about the role of recombination in speciation should be considered in the context of the variability of recombination rates and patterns more generally and that genic as well as chromosomal causes of restricted recombination should be considered. I review patterns of variation in recombination rates and theoretical progress in understanding the conditions that favour increased or decreased rates. Although progress has been made in understanding conditions that alter overall rates of recombination, widespread variation in patterns of recombination remains largely unexplained. I consider three models for the role of locally restricted recombination in speciation and the evidence currently supporting them.},

  Abstract                 = {Substrate-transmitted sexual signals and female responses to synthetic male signals were analysed for three populations of brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Homoptera: Delphacidae). Mean female preferences closely match mean male signal pulse repetition frequencies (PRF) in each population, despite marked differences among populations in PRF of both male and female signals. Female response windows (the range of male signal PRFs that elicit responses) were similar in all populations and wide relative to male signal variation. The Wright-Castle-Lande method was used to estimate the number of loci affecting differences between populations in male and female sexual signals and female preferences. Estimates obtained using the Lande formulae were compared with estimates from an iterative model-fitting approach. No sex linkage was observed. The characters conformed to the expectations of additive inheritance, with directional dominance in two cases. Estimates for the number of loci involved in signal characters were low, ranging from 1.4 to 5.3. After corrections for bias in the estimation method, estimates range from 2 to 16 but are still substantially lower than the recombination index of about 25. Estimates of the number of loci influencing female preference were unreliable. The two estimation methods gave compatible results but the iterative estimation method made better use of the data and gave clearer guidance on the support for the estimates. The results are discussed in the light of potential causes of divergence in sexual signalling systems. },

Gene frequencies at the Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) locus were found not to vary significantly between sites, nor over the five year period of their study. Genotype distributions are compared with Hardy-Weinberg expectations and show consistent, mostly significant, differences. These results are interpreted in the light of an association between the Adh locus and a chromosomal inversion polymorphism. It is argued that the remarkable geographical uniformity must indicate the presence of strong selection, probably taking the form of heterokaryotypic advantage.},

  Abstract                 = {The most common classification of modes of speciation begins with the spatial context in which divergence occurs: sympatric, parapatric or allopatric. This classification is unsatisfactory because it divides a continuum into discrete categories, concentrating attention on the extremes, and it subordinates other dimensions on which speciation processes vary, such as the forces driving differentiation and the genetic basis of reproductive isolation. It also ignores the fact that speciation is a prolonged process that commonly has phases in different spatial contexts. We use the example of local adaptation and partial reproductive isolation in the intertidal gastropod Littorina saxatilis to illustrate the inadequacy of the spatial classification of speciation modes. Parallel divergence in shell form in response to similar environmental gradients in England, Spain and Sweden makes this an excellent model system. However, attempts to demonstrate 'incipient' and 'sympatric' speciation involve speculation about the future and the past. We suggest that it is more productive to study the current balance between local adaptation and gene flow, the interaction between components of reproductive isolation and the genetic basis of differentiation.},

In this review, we consider issues of current interest in several areas, show where ostracods are already providing valuable insights and suggest new ways in which they might be used. We concentrate on non-marine ostracods. The evolutionary maintenance of sexual reproduction is one of the biggest unsolved questions in evolutionary biology and, because they show a wide diversity of asexual forms, non-marine ostracods can help to provide the answer. Recent advances from studies based on fossil data, ecology and molecular genetic approaches are reviewed. Other areas in which ostracods might be used more than they have been to date and that are considered more briefly are: sexual selection on the large and complex genitalia and spermatozoa, the causes and rates of speciation, the consequences of metapopulation structure and the factors determining the boundaries to the geographic ranges of species and the local diversity of species. },

We have examined morphological characters in two cols about 200 km apart and compared the positions and widths of clines for these characters both within and between cols. Clines are neither coincident (centred in the same position), nor concordant (equal in width) in either col. Furthermore clines are wider and more dispersed in the western col. The lack of concordance can be explained on several models for the maintenance of the hybrid zone and is a common observation. There are many fewer examples of lack of coincidence and this result is more difficult to interpret. We suggest that it is due to a difference in population structure between the cols: a patchy distribution of grasshoppers in the western col produces wider, more dispersed clines while a sharp break in distribution in the eastern col tends to concentrate morphological change over a shorter distance.},

  Abstract                 = {Species are the units used to measure ecological diversity and alleles are the units of genetic diversity. Genetic variation within and among species has been documented most extensively using allozyme electrophoresis. This reveals wide differences in genetic variability within, and genetic distances among, species, demonstrating that species are not equivalent units of diversity. The extent to which the pattern observed for allozymes can be used to infer patterns of genetic variation in quantitative traits depends on the forces generating and maintaining variability. Allozyme variation is probably not strictly neutral but, nevertheless, heterozygosity is expected to be influenced by population size and genetic distance will be affected by time since divergence. The same is true for quantitative traits influenced by many genes and under weak stabilizing selection. However, the limited data available suggest that allozyme variability is a poor predictor of genetic variation in quantitative traits within populations. It is a better predictor of general phenotypic divergence and of postzygotic isolation between populations or species, but is only weakly correlated with prezygotic isolation. Studies of grasshopper and planthopper mating signal variation and assortative mating illustrate how these characters evolve independently of general genetic and morphological variation. The role of such traits in prezygotic isolation, and hence speciation, means that they will contribute significantly to the diversity of levels of genetic variation within and among species.},

  Abstract                 = {When individuals interact, phenotypic variation can be partitioned into direct genetic effects (DGEs) of the individuals‚Äô own genotypes, indirect genetic effects (IGEs) of their social partners‚Äô genotypes and epistatic interactions between the genotypes of interacting individuals (‚Äògenotype-by-genotype (G√óG) epistasis‚Äô). These components can all play important roles in evolutionary processes, but few empirical studies have examined their importance. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum provides an ideal system to measure these effects during social interactions and development. When starved, free-living amoebae aggregate and differentiate into a multicellular fruiting body with a dead stalk that holds aloft viable spores. By measuring interactions among a set of natural strains, we quantify DGEs, IGEs and G√óG epistasis affecting spore formation. We find that DGEs explain most of the phenotypic variance (57.6%) whereas IGEs explain a smaller (13.3%) but highly significant component. Interestingly, G√óG epistasis explains nearly a quarter of the variance (23.0%), highlighting the complex nature of genotype interactions. These results demonstrate the large impact that social interactions can have on development and suggest that social effects should play an important role in developmental evolution in this system.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The vasopressin receptor type 1b (AVPR1B) is mainly expressed by pituitary corticotropes and it mediates the stimulatory effects of AVP on ACTH release; common AVPR1B haplotypes have been involved in mood and anxiety disorders in humans, while rodents lacking a functional receptor gene display behavioral defects and altered stress responses. RESULTS: Here we have analyzed the two exons of the gene and the data we present suggest that AVPR1B has been subjected to natural selection in humans. In particular, analysis of exon 2 strongly suggests the action of balancing selection in African populations and Europeans: the region displays high nucleotide diversity, an excess of intermediate-frequency alleles, a higher level of within-species diversity compared to interspecific divergence and a genealogy with common haplotypes separated by deep branches. This relatively unambiguous situation coexists with unusual features across exon 1, raising the possibility that a nonsynonymous variant (Gly191Arg) in this region has been subjected to directional selection. CONCLUSION: Although the underlying selective pressure(s) remains to be identified, we consider this to be among the first documented examples of a gene involved in mood disorders and subjected to natural selection in humans; this observation might add support to the long-debated idea that depression/low mood might have played an adaptive role during human evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Defensins, small endogenous peptides with antimicrobial activity, are pivotal components of the innate immune response. A large cluster of defensin genes is located on human chromosome 8p; among them the beta defensin 1 (DEFB1) promoterhas been extensively studied since discovery that specific polymorphisms and haplotypes associate with asthma and atopy, susceptibility to severe sepsis, as well as HIV and Candida infection predisposition. RESULTS: Here, we characterize the sequence variation and haplotype structure of the DEFB1 promoter region in six human populations. In all of them, we observed high levels of nucleotide variation, an excess of intermediate-frequency alleles, reduced population differentiation and a genealogy with common haplotypes separated by deep branches. Indeed, a significant departure from the expectation of evolutionary neutrality was observed in all populations and the possibility that this is due to demographic history alone was ruled out. Also, we verified that the selection signature is restricted to the promoter region and not due to a linked balanced polymorphism. A phylogeny-based estimation indicated that the two major haplotype clades separated around 4.5 million years ago, approximately the time when the human and chimpanzee lineages split. CONCLUSION: Altogether, these features represent strong molecular signatures of long-term balancing selection, a process that is thought to be extremely rare outside major histocompatibility complex genes. Our data indicate that the DEFB1 promoter region carries functional variants and support previous hypotheses whereby alleles predisposing to atopic disorders are widespread in modern societies because they conferred resistance to pathogens in ancient settings.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies offer the opportunity for population genomic study of non-model organisms sampled in the wild. The transcriptome is a convenient and popular target for such purposes. However, designing genetic markers from NGS transcriptome data requires assembling gene-coding sequences out of short reads. This is a complex task owing to gene duplications, genetic polymorphism, alternative splicing and transcription noise. Typical assembling programmes return thousands of predicted contigs, whose connection to the species true gene content is unclear, and from which SNP definition is uneasy. Here, the transcriptomes of five diverse non-model animal species (hare, turtle, ant, oyster and tunicate) were assembled from newly generated 454 and Illumina sequence reads. In two species for which a reference genome is available, a new procedure was introduced to annotate each predicted contig as either a full-length cDNA, fragment, chimera, allele, paralogue, genomic sequence or other, based on the number of, and overlap between, blast hits to the appropriate reference. Analyses showed that (i) the highest quality assemblies are obtained when 454 and Illumina data are combined, (ii) typical de novo assemblies include a majority of irrelevant cDNA predictions and (iii) assemblies can be appropriately cleaned by filtering contigs based on length and coverage. We conclude that robust, reference-free assembly of thousands of genes from transcriptomic NGS data is possible, opening promising perspectives for transcriptome-based population genomics in animals. A Galaxy pipeline implementing our best-performing assembling strategy is provided.},

  Abstract                 = {Much of the diversity of herbivorous insects stems from the adaptive divergence of populations onto different host plants. This often involves the evolution of specialized patterns of host acceptance that in turn lead to assortative mating for insects that mate exclusively on their hosts. Here, we explore the genetic architecture of feeding behavior in a herbivorous insect that has become a model for the study of incipient speciation, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum). We use crosses between individuals specialized to either alfalfa or red clover in order to perform both a biometrical analysis and a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of key feeding behaviors. For each character in each environment, Castle?Wright's estimator for the number of effective factors segregating ranged from 0.11 to 2.54. Similarly, between 0 and 3 QTLs were detected. In one case, a single QTL explained over 50% of the variance in the F2, suggesting that at least one gene (or a complex of tightly linked genes) has a major effect on feeding behavior in the pea aphid. However, the identified QTL explain only 23?73% of the genetic variance for these characters thus additional genes of minor effect are also involved. We found a variety of modes of gene action, including several cases of non-additive gene action. Our results suggest that feeding behavior in pea aphids is neither simple nor highly polygenic. The oligogenetic basis of variation in feeding behavior may facilitate host shifts, providing one explanation for the frequent divergence and speciation of herbivorous insects.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications.RESULTS:We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site.CONCLUSION:The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

  Abstract                 = {The desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) has been used as material for numerous cytogenetic studies. Its genome size is estimated to be 8.55¬†Gb of DNA comprised in 11 autosomes and the X chromosome. Its X0/XX sex chromosome determinism therefore results in females having 24 chromosomes whereas males have 23. Surprisingly, little is known about the DNA content of this locust's huge chromosomes. Here, we use the Feulgen Image Analysis Densitometry and C-banding techniques to respectively estimate the DNA quantity and heterochromatin content of each chromosome. We also identify three satellite DNAs using both restriction endonucleases and next-generation sequencing. We then use fluorescent in situ hybridization to determine the chromosomal location of these satellite DNAs as well as that of six tandem repeat DNA gene families. The combination of the results obtained in this work allows distinguishing between the different chromosomes not only by size, but also by the kind of repetitive DNAs that they contain. The recent publication of the draft genome of the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria), the largest animal genome hitherto sequenced, invites for sequencing even larger genomes. S. gregaria is a pest that causes high economic losses. It is thus among the primary candidates for genome sequencing. But this species genome is about 50¬†{\%} larger than that of L. migratoria, and although next-generation sequencing currently allows sequencing large genomes, sequencing it would mean a greater challenge. The chromosome sizes and markers provided here should not only help planning the sequencing project and guide the assembly but would also facilitate assigning assembled linkage groups to actual chromosomes.},

  Abstract                 = {INFERRING PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CLOSELY RELATED TAXA CAN BE HINDERED BY THREE FACTORS: (1) the lack of informative molecular variation at short evolutionary timescale; (2) the lack of established markers in poorly studied taxa; and (3) the potential phylogenetic conflicts among different genomic regions due to incomplete lineage sorting or introgression. In this context, Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) seems promising as this technique can generate sequence data from numerous DNA fragments scattered throughout the genome, from a large number of samples, and without preliminary knowledge on the taxa under study. However, divergence beyond the within-species level will necessarily reduce the number of conserved and non-duplicated restriction sites, and therefore the number of loci usable for phylogenetic inference. Here, we assess the suitability of RAD-seq for phylogeny using a simulated experiment on the 12 Drosophila genomes, with divergence times ranging from 5 to 63 million years. These simulations show that RAD-seq allows the recovery of the known Drosophila phylogeny with strong statistical support, even for relatively ancient nodes. Notably, this conclusion is robust to the potentially confounding effects of sequencing errors, heterozygosity, and low coverage. We further show that clustering RAD-seq data using the BLASTN and SiLiX programs significantly improves the recovery of orthologous RAD loci compared with previously proposed approaches, especially for distantly related species. This study therefore validates the view that RAD sequencing is a powerful tool for phylogenetic inference.},

From these datasets we estimated theta using the maximum likelihood coalescent framework implemented in the computer program Migrate. Our results corroborated the theoretical expectation that increasing the number of loci impacted the accuracy of the estimate more than increasing the sequence length at single loci. However, when the value of theta was low (0.001), the per-locus sequence length was also important for estimating theta accurately, something that has not been emphasized in previous work.Accurate estimation of theta required data from at least 25 independently evolving loci. Beyond this, there was little added benefit in terms of decreasing the squared coefficient of variation of the coalescent estimates relative to the extra effort required to sample more loci.},

  Abstract                 = {Biodiversity hotspots, representing regions with high species endemism and conservation threat, have been mapped globally. Yet, biodiversity distribution data from within hotspots are too sparse for effective conservation in the face of rapid environmental change. Using frogs as indicators, ecological niche models under paleoclimates, and simultaneous Bayesian analyses of multispecies molecular data, we compare alternative hypotheses of assemblage-scale response to late Quaternary climate change. This reveals a hotspot within the Brazilian Atlantic forest hotspot. We show that the southern Atlantic forest was climatically unstable relative to the central region, which served as a large climatic refugium for neotropical species in the late Pleistocene. This sets new priorities for conservation in Brazil and establishes a validated approach to biodiversity prediction in other understudied, species-rich regions.},

  Abstract                 = {Variable flows of food, water, or other ecosystem services complicate planning. Management strategies that decrease variability and increase predictability may therefore be preferred. However, actions to decrease variance over short timescales (2-4 y), when applied continuously, may lead to long-term ecosystem changes with adverse consequences. We investigated the effects of managing short-term variance in three well-understood models of ecosystem services: lake eutrophication, harvest of a wild population, and yield of domestic herbivores on a rangeland. In all cases, actions to decrease variance can increase the risk of crossing critical ecosystem thresholds, resulting in less desirable ecosystem states. Managing to decrease short-term variance creates ecosystem fragility by changing the boundaries of safe operating spaces, suppressing information needed for adaptive management, cancelling signals of declining resilience, and removing pressures that may build tolerance of stress. Thus, the management of variance interacts strongly and inseparably with the management of resilience. By allowing for variation, learning, and flexibility while observing change, managers can detect opportunities and problems as they develop while sustaining the capacity to deal with them.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimating phylogenetic relationships among closely related species can be extremely difficult when there is incongruence among gene trees and between the gene trees and the species tree. Here we show that incorporating a model of the stochastic loss of gene lineages by genetic drift into the phylogenetic estimation procedure can provide a robust estimate of species relationships, despite widespread incomplete sorting of ancestral polymorphism. This approach is applied to a group of montane Melanoplus grasshoppers for which genealogical discordance among loci and incomplete lineage sorting obscures any obvious phylogenetic relationships among species. Unlike traditional treatments where gene trees estimated using standard phylogenetic methods are implicitly equated with the species tree, with the coalescent-based approach the species tree is modeled probabilistically from the estimated gene trees. The estimated species phylogeny (the ESP) is calculated for the grasshoppers from multiple gene trees reconstructed for nuclear loci and a mitochondrial gene. This empirical application is coupled with a simulation study to explore the performance of the coalescent-based approach. Specifically, we test the accuracy of the ESP given the data based on analyses of simulated data matching the multilocus data collected in Melanoplus (i.e., data were simulated for each locus with the same number of base pairs and locus-specific mutational models). The results of the study show that ESPs can be computed using the coalescent-based approach long before reciprocal monophyly has been achieved, and that these statistical estimates are accurate. This contrasts with analyses of the empirical data collected in Melanoplus and simulated data based on concatenation of multiple loci, for which the incomplete lineage sorting of recently diverged species posed significant problems. The strengths and potential challenges associated with incorporating an explicit model of gene-lineage coalescence into the phylogenetic procedure to obtain an ESP, as illustrated by application to Melanoplus, versus concatenation and consensus approaches are discussed. This study represents a fundamental shift in how species relationships are estimated - the relationship between the gene trees and the species phylogeny is modeled probabilistically rather than equating gene trees with a species tree.},

  Abstract                 = {Questions about how shifting distributions contribute to species diversification remain virtually without answer, even though rapid climate change during the Pleistocene clearly impacted genetic variation within many species. One factor that has prevented this question from being adequately addressed is the lack of precision associated with estimates of species divergence made from a single genetic locus and without incorporating processes that are biologically important as populations diverge. Analysis of DNA sequences from multiple variable loci in a coalescent framework that (i) corrects for gene divergence pre-dating speciation, and (ii) derives divergence-time estimates without making a priori assumptions about the processes underlying patterns of incomplete lineage sorting between species (i.e. allows for the possibility of gene flow during speciation), is critical to overcoming the inherent logistical and analytical difficulties of inferring the timing and mode of speciation during the dynamic Pleistocene. Estimates of species divergence that ignore these processes, use single locus data, or do both can dramatically overestimate species divergence. For example, using a coalescent approach with data from six loci, the divergence between two species of montane Melanoplus grasshoppers is estimated at between 200,000 and 300,000 years before present, far more recently than divergence estimates made using single-locus data or without the incorporation of population-level processes. Melanoplus grasshoppers radiated in the sky islands of the Rocky Mountains, and the analysis of divergence between these species suggests that the isolation of populations in multiple glacial refugia was an important factor in promoting speciation. Furthermore, the low estimates of gene flow between the species indicate that reproductive isolation must have evolved rapidly for the incipient species boundaries to be maintained through the subsequent glacial periods and shifts in species distributions.},

Such changes in representation hinder applications requiring accurate quantification of template molecules, such as allele calling or estimation of microbial diversity. We present a simple method to count the number of template molecules using degenerate bases and show that it improves genotyping accuracy and removes noise from PCR amplification. This method can be easily added to existing DNA library preparation techniques and can improve the accuracy of variant calling.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding how genetic variation is partitioned across genomes within and among populations is a fundamental problem in ecological and evolutionary genetics. To address this problem, we studied the threespine stickleback fish, which has repeatedly undergone parallel phenotypic and genetic differentiation when oceanic fish have invaded freshwater habitats. While significant evolutionary genetic research has been performed using stickleback from geographic regions that have been deglaciated in the last 20 000 years, less research has focused on freshwater populations that predate the last glacial maximum. We performed restriction-site associated DNA-sequencing (RAD-seq) based population genomic analyses on stickleback from across Oregon, which was not glaciated during the last maximum. We sampled stickleback from coastal, Willamette Basin and central Oregon sites, analysed their genetic diversity using RAD-seq, performed structure analyses, reconstructed their phylogeographic history and tested the hypothesis of recent stickleback introduction into central Oregon, where incidence of this species was only recently documented. Our results showed a clear phylogeographic break between coastal and inland populations, with oceanic populations exhibiting the lowest levels of divergence from one another. Willamette Basin and central Oregon populations formed a clade of closely related populations, a finding consistent with a recent introduction of stickleback into central Oregon. Finally, genome-wide analysis of genetic diversity (π) and correlations of alleles within individuals in subpopulations (FIS) supported a role for introgressive hybridization in coastal populations and a recent expansion in central Oregon. Our results exhibit the power of next-generation sequencing genomic approaches such as RAD-seq to identify both historical population structure and recent colonization history.},

  Abstract                 = {Drosophila's importance as a model organism made it an obvious choice to be among the first genomes sequenced, and the Release 1 sequence of the euchromatic portion of the genome was published in March 2000. This accomplishment demonstrated that a whole genome shotgun (WGS) strategy could produce a reliable metazoan genome sequence. Despite the attention to sequencing methods, the nucleotide sequence is just the starting point for genome-wide analyses; at a minimum, the genome sequence must be interpreted using expressed sequence tag (EST) and complementary DNA (cDNA) evidence and computational tools to identify genes and predict the structures of their RNA and protein products. The functions of these products and the manner in which their expression and activities are controlled must then be assessed-a much more challenging task with no clear endpoint that requires a wide variety of experimental and computational methods. We first review the current state of the Drosophila melanogaster genome sequence and its structural annotation and then briefly summarize some promising approaches that are being taken to achieve an initial functional annotation.},

  Abstract                 = {Microsatellite null alleles are commonly encountered in population genetics studies, yet little is known about their impact on the estimation of population differentiation. Computer simulations based on the coalescent were used to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of null alleles, their impact on FST and genetic distances, and the efficiency of estimators of null allele frequency. Further, we explored how the existing method for correcting genotype data for null alleles performed in estimating FST and genetic distances, and we compared this method with a new method proposed here (for FST only). Null alleles were likely to be encountered in populations with a large effective size, with an unusually high mutation rate in the flanking regions, and that have diverged from the population from which the cloned allele state was drawn and the primers designed. When populations were significantly differentiated, FST and genetic distances were overestimated in the presence of null alleles. Frequency of null alleles was estimated precisely with the algorithm presented in Dempster et al. (1977). The conventional method for correcting genotype data for null alleles did not provide an accurate estimate of FST and genetic distances. However, the use of the genetic distance of Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards (1967) corrected by the conventional method gave better estimates than those obtained without correction. FST estimation from corrected genotype frequencies performed well when restricted to visible allele sizes. Both the proposed method and the traditional correction method have been implemented in a program that is available free of charge at http://www.montpellier.inra.fr/URLB/. We used 2 published microsatellite data sets based on original and redesigned pairs of primers to empirically confirm our simulation results.},

  Abstract                 = {Theoretical arguments are presented which suggest that each advance of Muller's ratchet in a haploid asexual population causes the fixation of a deleterious mutation at a single locus. A similar process operates in a diploid, fully asexual population under a wide range of parameter values, with respect to fixation within one of the two haploid genomes. Fixations of deleterious mutations in asexual species can thus be greatly accelerated in comparison with a freely recombining genome, if the ratchet is operating. In a diploid with segregation of a single chromosome, but no crossing over within the chromosome, the advance of the ratchet can be decoupled from fixation if mutations are sufficiently close to recessivity. A new analytical approximation for the rate of advance of the ratchet is proposed. Simulation results are presented that validate the assertions about fixation. The simulations show that none of the analytical approximations for the rate of advance of the ratchet are satisfactory when population size is large. The relevance of these results for evolutionary processes such as Y chromosome degeneration is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Levels of neutral genetic diversity in populations subdivided into two demes were studied by multilocus stochastic simulations. The model includes deleterious mutations at loci throughout the genome, causing 'background selection', as well as a single locus at which a polymorphism is maintained, either by frequency-dependent selection or by local selective differences. These balanced polymorphisms induce long coalescence times at linked neutral loci, so that sequence diversity at these loci is enhanced at statistical equilibrium. We study how equilibrium neutral diversity levels are affected by the degree of population subdivision, the presence or absence of background selection, and the level of inbreeding of the population. The simulation results are compared with approximate analytical formulae, assuming the infinite sites neutral model. We discuss how balancing selection can be distinguished from local selection, by determining whether peaks of diversity in the region of the polymorphic locus are seen within or between demes. The width of such diversity peaks is shown to depend on the total species population size, rather than local deme sizes. We show that, with population subdivision, local selection enhances between-deme diversity even at neutral sites distant from the polymorphic locus, producing higher FST values than with no selection; very high values can be generated at sites close to a selected locus. Background selection also increases FST, mainly because of decreased diversity within populations, which implies that its effects may be distinguishable from those of local selection. Both effects are stronger in selfing than outcrossing populations. Linkage disequilibrium between neutral sites is generated by both balancing and local selection, especially in selfing populations, because of linkage disequilibrium between the neutral sites and the selectively maintained alleles. We discuss how these theoretical results can be related to data on genetic diversity within and between local populations of a species.},

Among the different plant mating systems, it is useful to distinguish two types of systems: 'sex systems', hermaphroditic versus male/female and other situations; and the 'mating systems' of hermaphroditic populations, inbreeding, outcrossing or intermediate. Evolutionary changes in breeding systems occur between closely related species, and some changes occur more often than others. Understanding why such changes occur requires combined genetical and ecological approaches. I review the ideas of some of the most important theoretical models, showing how these are based on individual selection using genetic principles to ask whether alleles affecting plants' outcrossing rates or sex morphs will spread in populations. After discussing how the conclusions are affected by some of the many relevant ecological factors, I relate these theoretical ideas to empirical data from some of the many recent breeding system studies in plant populations.},

However, the age of these systems is not yet very clear. Even without knowing what proportions of their genes are genetically degenerate, these cases are of great interest, as they may offer opportunities to study in detail how sex chromosomes evolve. In particular, we review evidence that recombination suppression occurs progressively in evolutionarily independent cases, suggesting that selection drives loss of recombination over increasingly large regions.

We used Agilent rice oligomicroarrays to explore gene expression changes following allopolyploidy in Spartina that includes a classic example of recent allopolyploid speciation: S. anglica formed during the 19th century following genome duplication of the hybrid S. x townsendii. Our data indicate important, but different, effects of hybridization and genome duplication in the expression patterns of the hybrid and allopolyploid. Deviation from parental additivity was most important following hybridization and was accompanied by maternal expression dominance, although transgressively expressed genes were also encountered. Maternal dominance was attenuated following genome duplication in S. anglica, but this species exhibits an increased number of transgressively overexpressed genes. These results reflect the decoupled effects of the 'genomic shock' following hybridization and genome redundancy on the genetic, epigenetic and regulatory mechanisms characterizing transcriptomic evolution in allopolyploids. },

Members of the two complexes have been confused and, consequently, their distributions and roles in malaria transmission are uncertain. We identified numerous mosquitoes from China, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Iran by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and/or sequencing, and analysed the variation in the 28S D3 region of ribosomal DNA for members of the Minimus Subgroup and also the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2) for members of the An. fluviatilis complex. The D3 region is highly conserved between taxa and therefore could serve as a standard for molecular diagnosis of the subgroup members. D3 sequence, bionomics and malaria transmission data provide further evidence that An. fluviatilis S in India is conspecific with An. minimus C in South-east Asia. An. fluviatilis T has three ITS2 haplotypes (designated T1, T2 and Y) and its distribution in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Iran is confirmed. An. fluviatilis U is well defined on cytogenetic grounds in Uttar Pradesh, India, but is very close to An. fluviatilis T and the two species may hybridize in some regions. Variant ITS2 sequences suggest the possible existence of two additional taxa within the An. fluviatilis complex, one in Iran and another in India, provisionally designated An. fluviatilis forms V and X, respectively. The distributions of members of the An. fluviatilis and An. minimus complexes in south-central Asia are summarized.},

Species A and C (sensu Green et al., 1990) of the An. minimus complex were found to be sympatric in Yunnan Province. Species A occurs eastward from Yunnan through southern Guangxi, Hainan, Guangdong and Taiwan Provinces, whereas species C occurs northward to northern Guangxi, Guizhou and Sichuan Provinces. Morphological and molecular evidence (based on specimens from the field and four isofemale lines) shows that An. minimus forms A and B (sensu Yu & Li, 1984) are morphological variants of species A, which is accepted as An. minimus Theobald sensu stricto (type-locality: Pokfulam, Hong Kong). The so-called subspecies x of An. minimus (sensu Baba, 1950) is reinterpreted as An. aconitus Dönitz. The distribution and vector status of members of the An. minimus group are discussed in relation to the historical and current transmission of malaria and filariasis in China. Both An. minimus A and C have been implicated as widespread vectors of malaria, whereas only species A has been found in Hainan, where An. minimus s.l. was a vector of Bancroftian filariasis. The presence of An. aconitus in Hainan and Yunnan Provinces is confirmed, but the occurrence of An. varuna Iyengar and An. fluviatilis James, which were previously recorded in China, could not be verified.},

We have also constructed a set of 62 Drosophila stocks, each of which facilitates the generation of recombinants within a defined genetic interval of 1-2 Mb. For flexible, high-throughput SNP genotyping, we used fluorescent tag-array mini-sequencing (TAMS) assays. We designed and validated TAMS assays for 293 SNPs at an average resolution of 391.3 kb, and demonstrated the utility of these tools by rapidly mapping 14 mutations that disrupt embryonic muscle patterning.

Here, we study how the neutral polymorphism pattern was shaped by two close recombining loci that cause 'sex-ratio' meiotic drive in Drosophila simulans, as an example of strong selection with potentially strong epistasis. We compare the polymorphism data observed in a natural population with the results of forward stochastic simulations under several contexts of epistasis between the candidate loci for the drive. We compute the likelihood of different possible scenarios, in order to determine which configuration is most consistent with the data. Our results highlight that fine scale analyses of well-chosen candidate genomic regions provide information-rich data that can be used to investigate the genotype-phenotype-fitness map, which can hardly be studied in genome-wide analyses. We also emphasize that initial conditions and time of observation (here, time after the interruption of a partial selective sweep) are crucial parameters in the interpretation of real data, while these are often overlooked in theoretical studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: The innovation of Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) method takes full advantage of next-generation sequencing technology. By clustering paired-end short reads into groups with their own unique tags, RAD-seq assembly problem is divided into subproblems. Fast and accurately clustering and assembling millions of RAD-seq reads with sequencing errors, different levels of heterozygosity and repetitive sequences is a challenging question.Results: Rainbow is developed to provide an ultra-fast and memory-efficient solution to clustering and assembling short reads produced by RAD-seq. First, Rainbow clusters reads using a spaced seed method. Then, Rainbow implements a heterozygote calling like strategy to divide potential groups into haplotypes in a top-down manner. And along a guided tree, it iteratively merges sibling leaves in a bottom-up manner if they are similar enough. Here, the similarity is defined by comparing the 2nd reads of a RAD segment. This approach tries to collapse heterozygote while discriminate repetitive sequences. At last, Rainbow uses a greedy algorithm to locally assemble merged reads into contigs. Rainbow not only outputs the optimal but also suboptimal assembly results. Based on simulation and a real guppy RAD-seq data, we show that Rainbow is more competent than the other tools in dealing with RAD-seq data.Availability: Source code in C, Rainbow is freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-rainbow/files/Contact: ruanjue@gmail.com },

  Abstract                 = {Natural hybrid zones have proven to be precious tools for understanding the origin and maintenance of reproductive isolation (RI) and therefore species. Most available genomic studies of hybrid zones using whole- or partial-genome resequencing approaches have focused on comparisons of the parental source populations involved in genome admixture, rather than exploring fine-scale patterns of chromosomal ancestry across the full admixture gradient present between hybridizing species. We have studied three well-known European ‚Äòreplicate‚Äô hybrid zones of Populus alba and P.¬†tremula, two widespread, ecologically divergent forest trees, using up to 432¬†505 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. Estimates of fine-scale chromosomal ancestry, genomic divergence and differentiation across all 19 poplar chromosomes revealed strikingly contrasting results, including an unexpected preponderance of F1 hybrids in the centre of genomic clines on the one hand, and genomically localized, spatially variable shared variants consistent with ancient introgression between the parental species on the other. Genetic ancestry had a significant effect on survivorship of hybrid seedlings in a common garden trial, pointing to selection against early-generation recombinants. Our results indicate a role for selection against recombinant genotypes in maintaining RI in the face of apparent F1 fertility, consistent with the intragenomic ‚Äòcoadaptation‚Äô model of barriers to introgression upon secondary contact. Whole-genome resequencing of hybridizing populations will clarify the roles of specific genetic pathways in RI between these model forest trees and may reveal which loci are affected most strongly by its cyclic breakdown.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT:Linkage maps are an integral resource for dissection of complex genetic traits in plant and animal species. Canonical map construction follows a well-established workflow: an initial discovery phase where genetic markers are mined from a small pool of individuals, followed by genotyping of selected mapping populations using sets of marker panels. A newly developed sequence-based marker technology, Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD), enables synchronous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker discovery and genotyping using massively parallel sequencing. The objective of this research was to assess the utility of RAD markers for linkage map construction, employing barley as a model system. Using the published high density EST-based SNP map in the Oregon Wolfe Barley (OWB) mapping population as a reference, we created a RAD map using a limited set of prior markers to establish linakge group identity, integrated the RAD and prior data, and used both maps for detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL).Using the RAD protocol in tandem with the Illumina sequence by synthesis platform, a total of 530 SNP markers were identified from initial scans of the OWB parental inbred lines - the "dominant" and "recessive" marker stocks - and scored in a 93 member doubled haploid (DH) mapping population. RAD sequence data from the structured population was converted into allele genotypes from which a genetic map was constructed. The assembled RAD-only map consists of 445 markers with an average interval length of 5 cM, while an integrated map includes 463 RAD loci and 2383 prior markers. Sequenced RAD markers are distributed across all seven chromosomes, with polymorphic loci emanating from both coding and noncoding regions in the Hordeum genome. Total map lengths are comparable and the order of common markers is identical in both maps. The same large-effect QTL for reproductive fitness traits were detected with both maps and the majority of these QTL were coincident with a dwarfing gene (ZEO) and the VRS1 gene, which determines the two-row and six-row germplasm groups of barley.We demonstrate how sequenced RAD markers can be leveraged to produce high quality linkage maps for detection of single gene loci and QTLs. By combining SNP discovery and genotyping into parallel sequencing events, RAD markers should be a useful molecular breeding tool for a range of crop species. Expected improvements in cost and throughput of second and third-generation sequencing technologies will enable more powerful applications of the sequenced RAD marker system, including improvements in de novo genome assembly, development of ultra-high density genetic maps and association mapping.},

  Abstract                 = {Phenotypic divergence in the male reproductive system (genitalia and gonads) between species of the Drosophila melanogaster complex and their hybrids was quantified to decipher the role of these traits in species differentiation and speciation. Internal as well as external, sexual and nonsexual traits were analyzed with respect to genetic variation and trait asymmetry between strains within species, genetic divergence between species, and dominance and asymmetry in species and hybrids. The variation between strains within species was significant among sexual traits, and only external traits were less asymmetric than internal ones, which suggests that sexual traits are not strongly constrained within species. Three main findings show that sexual traits are most divergent between species: (1) testis length and area, and the area of the posterior lobe of the genital arch (sexual traits) showed the highest proportion of variation between species; (2) linear discriminant functions with the highest components associated to sexual traits were better predictors of species membership; and (3) testis length and area revealed a departure from a linear relationship between members of the species group. Examination of interspecific hybrids showed that sexual traits had higher asymmetry in species hybrids than in the parental species and that sexual traits showed additivity or dominance whereas nonsexual traits showed overdominance (with the exception of malpighian tubules length). These results suggest that sexual traits have undergone more genetic changes and, as a result, tend to show higher divergence and stronger hybrid breakdown between species than nonsexual traits. We propose that sexual selection in the broad sense, affecting all aspects of sexuality, may be responsible for the diversified appearance of sexual traits among closely related species and that the genetic architecture underlying sexual traits may be more prone to disruption during the early stages of speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {Reproductive isolation and speciation can result from the establishment of either premating or postmating barriers that restrict gene flow between populations. Recent studies of speciation have been dominated by a molecular approach to dissect the genetic basis of hybrid male sterility, a specific form of postmating reproductive isolation. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the evolution of genes involved in premating isolation and genes generally involved in other sex-related functions (e.g., mating behavior, fertilization, spermatogenesis, sex determination). We have assembled DNA sequences from 51 nuclear genes and classified them based on their functional characteristics. The proportion of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions were compared between Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans, and Drosophila pseudoobscura, as well as between Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae. We found a high ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions for sex-related genes (i.e., genes involved in mating behavior, fertilization, spermatogenesis, or sex determination). The results suggest that directional sexual selection has shaped the evolution of sex-related genes and that these changes have more likely occurred during the early stages of speciation. It is possible that directional selection becomes relaxed after reproductive isolation has been completed between more distantly related species (e.g., D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura). However, a saturation in the number of nucleotide substitutions since the time of species separation may mask any sign of directional selection between more distantly related species.},

  Abstract                 = {The cichlids of East Africa are renowned as one of the most spectacular examples of adaptive radiation. They provide a unique opportunity to investigate the relationships between ecology, morphological diversity, and phylogeny in producing such remarkable diversity. Nevertheless, the parameters of the adaptive radiations of these fish have not been satisfactorily quantified yet. Lake Tanganyika possesses all of the major lineages of East African cichlid fish, so by using geometric morphometrics and comparative analyses of ecology and morphology, in an explicitly phylogenetic context, we quantify the role of ecology in driving adaptive speciation. We used geometric morphometric methods to describe the body shape of over 1000 specimens of East African cichlid fish, with a focus on the Lake Tanganyika species assemblage, which is composed of more than 200 endemic species. The main differences in shape concern the length of the whole body and the relative sizes of the head and caudal peduncle. We investigated the influence of phylogeny on similarity of shape using both distance-based and variance partitioning methods, finding that phylogenetic inertia exerts little influence on overall body shape. Therefore, we quantified the relative effect of major ecological traits on shape using phylogenetic generalized least squares and disparity analyses. These analyses conclude that body shape is most strongly predicted by feeding preferences (i.e., trophic niches) and the water depths at which species occur. Furthermore, the morphological disparity within tribes indicates that even though the morphological diversification associated with explosive speciation has happened in only a few tribes of the Tanganyikan assemblage, the potential to evolve diverse morphologies exists in all tribes. Quantitative data support the existence of extensive parallelism in several independent adaptive radiations in Lake Tanganyika. Notably, Tanganyikan mouthbrooders belonging to the C-lineage and the substrate spawning Lamprologini have evolved a multitude of different shapes from elongated and Lamprologus-like hypothetical ancestors. Together, these data demonstrate strong support for the adaptive character of East African cichlid radiations.},

  Abstract                 = {The prospect of using linkage disequilibrium (LD) for fine-scale mapping in humans has attracted considerable attention, and, during the validation of a set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for linkage analysis, a set of data for 4,833 SNPs in 538 clusters was produced that provides a rich picture of local attributes of LD across the genome. LD estimates may be biased depending on the means by which SNPs are first identified, and a particular problem of ascertainment bias arises when SNPs identified in small heterogeneous panels are subsequently typed in larger population samples. Understanding and correcting ascertainment bias is essential for a useful quantitative assessment of the landscape of LD across the human genome. Heterogeneity in the population recombination rate, rho=4Nr, along the genome reflects how variable the density of markers will have to be for optimal coverage. We find that ascertainment-corrected rho varies along the genome by more than two orders of magnitude, implying great differences in the recombinational history of different portions of our genome. The distribution of rho is unimodal, and we show that this is compatible with a wide range of mixtures of hotspots in a background of variable recombination rate. Although rho is significantly correlated across the three population samples, some regions of the genome exhibit population-specific spikes or troughs in rho that are too large to be explained by sampling. This result is consistent with differences in the genealogical depth of local genomic regions, a finding that has direct bearing on the design and utility of LD mapping and on the National Institutes of Health HapMap project.},

  Abstract                 = {The isochore theory, proposed nearly three decades ago, depicts the mammalian genome as a mosaic of long, fairly homogeneous genomic regions that are characterized by their guanine and cytosine (GC) content. The human genome, for instance, was claimed to consist of five distinct isochore families: L1, L2, H1, H2, and H3, with GC contents of <37\%, 37\%-42\%, 42\%-47\%, 47\%-52\%, and >52\%, respectively. In this paper, we address the question of the validity of the isochore theory through a rigorous sequence-based analysis of the human genome. Toward this end, we adopt a set of six attributes that are generally claimed to characterize isochores and statistically test their veracity against the available draft sequence of the complete human genome. By the selection criteria used in this study: distinctiveness, homogeneity, and minimal length of 300 kb, we identify 1,857 genomic segments that warrant the label "isochore." These putative isochores are nonuniformly scattered throughout the genome and cover about 41\% of the human genome. We found that a four-family model of putative isochores is the most parsimonious multi-Gaussian model that can be fitted to the empirical data. These families, however, are GC poor, with mean GC contents of 35\%, 38\%, 41\%, and 48\% and do not resemble the five isochore families in the literature. Moreover, due to large overlaps among the families, it is impossible to classify genomic segments into isochore families reliably, according to compositional properties alone. These findings undermine the utility of the isochore theory and seem to indicate that the theory may have reached the limits of its usefulness as a description of genomic compositional structures.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: One key question in evolutionary biology deals with the mode and rate at which reproductive isolation accumulates during allopatric speciation. Little is known about secondary contacts of recently diverged anuran species. Here we conduct a multi-locus field study to investigate a contact zone between two lineages of green toads with an estimated divergence time of 2.7 My, and report results from preliminary experimental crosses. RESULTS: The Sicilian endemic Bufo siculus and the Italian mainland-origin B. balearicus form a narrow hybrid zone east of Mt. Etna. Despite bidirectional mtDNA introgression over a ca. 40 km North-South cline, no F1 hybrids could be found, and nuclear genomes display almost no admixture. Populations from each side of the contact zone showed depressed genetic diversity and very strong differentiation (FST = 0.52). Preliminary experimental crosses point to a slightly reduced fitness in F1 hybrids, a strong hybrid breakdown in backcrossed offspring (F1 x parental, with very few reaching metamorphosis) and a complete and early mortality in F2 (F1 x F1). CONCLUSION: Genetic patterns at the contact zone are molded by drift and selection. Local effective sizes are reduced by the geography and history of the contact zone, B. balearicus populations being at the front wave of a recent expansion (late Pleistocene). Selection against hybrids likely results from intrinsic genomic causes (disruption of coadapted sets of genes in backcrosses and F2-hybrids), possibly reinforced by local adaptation (the ranges of the two taxa roughly coincide with the borders of semiarid and arid climates). The absence of F1 in the field might be due to premating isolation mechanisms. Our results, show that these lineages have evolved almost complete reproductive isolation after some 2.7 My of divergence, contrasting sharply with evidence from laboratory experiments that some anuran species may still produce viable F1 offspring after > 20 My of divergence. },

  Abstract                 = {Population differentiation has proved to be effective for identifying loci under geographically localized positive selection, and has the potential to identify loci subject to balancing selection. We have previously investigated the pattern of genetic differentiation among human populations at 36.8 million genomic variants to identify sites in the genome showing high frequency differences. Here, we extend this dataset to include additional variants, survey sites with low levels of differentiation, and evaluate the extent to which highly differentiated sites are likely to result from selective or other processes.We demonstrate that while sites with low differentiation represent sampling effects rather than balancing selection, sites showing extremely high population differentiation are enriched for positive selection events and that one half may be the result of classic selective sweeps. Among these, we rediscover known examples, where we actually identify the established functional SNP, and discover novel examples including the genes ABCA12, CALD1 and ZNF804, which we speculate may be linked to adaptations in skin, calcium metabolism and defense, respectively.We identify known and many novel candidate regions for geographically restricted positive selection, and suggest several directions for further research.},

Our analysis indicated phylogeographic variation similar in magnitude to that found in other regions of Continental Europe and suggests a recent population expansion. We present evidence which supports a single post-glacial colonization into the UK. Dispersal time calculations, calibrated with geophysical events, are coincident with the start of the Holocene period, 7.5-11 kya, a time when geological evidence suggests temperatures were stable, woodland habitat was prevalent and a land bridge was present to allow the dispersal of small mammals into the UK. We discuss our findings in the context of the extant geographical genetic structure described here and in relation to conservation management of this threatened species.},

Although numerous examples of such 'ecological speciation' now exist, the genomic basis of the process, and the role of gene flow in it, remains less understood. This is, at least in part, because systems that are well characterized in terms of their ecology often lack genomic resources. In this study, we characterize the transcriptome of Timema cristinae stick insects, a system that has been researched intensively in terms of ecological speciation, but for which genomic resources have not been previously developed. Specifically, we obtained >1 million 454 sequencing reads that assembled into 84,937 contigs representing approximately 18,282 unique genes and tens of thousands of potential molecular markers. Second, as an illustration of their utility, we used these genomic resources to assess multilocus genetic divergence within both an ecotype pair and a species pair of Timema stick insects. The results suggest variable levels of genetic divergence and gene flow among taxon pairs and genes and illustrate a first step towards future genomic work in Timema.},

  Abstract                 = {Two ecotypes of a marine intertidal snail (Littorina saxatilis), living at different microhabitats and shore levels, have evolved in sympatry and in parallel across the Galician rocky shore. These ecotypes differ in many traits (including size) due to differential adaptation. They meet, mate assortatively, and partially hybridize at the mid shore where the two microhabitats overlap. The partial sexual isolation observed is claimed to be a side-effect of the size differences between ecotypes combined with a size assortative mating found in most populations of this species. We investigated this hypothesis using three complementary experimental approaches. First, we investigated which of the different shell variables contributed most to the variation in individual sexual isolation in the field by using two new statistics developed for that purpose: (1) pair sexual isolation and (2) ri, which is based on the Pearson correlation coefficient. We found that size is the most important trait explaining the sexual isolation and, in particular, the males appear to be the key sex contributing to sexual isolation. Second, we compared the size assortative mating between regions: exposed rocky shore populations from north-westwern Spain (showing incomplete reproductive isolation due to size assortative mating) and protected Spanish and Swedish populations (showing size assortative mating but not reproductive isolation between ecomorphs). Most of the variation in size assortative mating between localities was significantly explained by the within-population level of variation on size. Third, we performed a laboratory male choice experiment, which further suggested that the choice is made predominantly on the basis of size. These results confirm the mechanism proposed to explain the sexual isolation in the Galician hybrid zone and thus support this case as a putative example of parallel incipient speciation. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2008, 94, 5132013526.},

  Abstract                 = {Disruptive selection between males and females can generate sexual antagonism, where alleles improving fitness in one sex reduce fitness in the other. This type of genetic conflict arises because males and females carry nearly identical sets of genes: opposing selection, followed by genetic mixing during reproduction, generates a population genetic âtug-of-warâ that constrains adaptation in either sex. Recent verbal models suggest that gene duplication and sex-specific cooption of paralogs might resolve sexual antagonism and facilitate evolutionary divergence between the sexes. However, this intuitive proximal solution for sexual dimorphism potentially belies a complex interaction between mutation, genetic drift, and positive selection during duplicate fixation and sex-specific paralog differentiation. The interaction of these processesâwithin the explicit context of duplication and sexual antagonismâhas yet to be formally described by population genetics theory. Here, we develop and analyze models of gene duplication and sex-specific differentiation between paralogs. We show that sexual antagonism can favor the fixation and maintenance of gene duplicates, eventually leading to the evolution of sexually dimorphic genetic architectures for male and female traits. The timescale for these evolutionary transitions is sensitive to a suite of genetic and demographic variables, including allelic dominance, recombination, sex linkage, and population size. Interestingly, we find that female-beneficial duplicates preferentially accumulate on the X chromosome, whereas male-beneficial duplicates are biased toward autosomes, independent of the dominance parameters of sexually antagonistic alleles. Although this result differs from previous models of sexual antagonism, it is consistent with several findings from the empirical genomics literature.},

Here we present, to our knowledge, the first direct comparative analysis of male and female germline mutation rates from the complete genome sequences of two parent-offspring trios. Through extensive validation, we identified 49 and 35 germline de novo mutations (DNMs) in two trio offspring, as well as 1,586 non-germline DNMs arising either somatically or in the cell lines from which the DNA was derived. Most strikingly, in one family, we observed that 92\% of germline DNMs were from the paternal germline, whereas, in contrast, in the other family, 64\% of DNMs were from the maternal germline. These observations suggest considerable variation in mutation rates within and between families.},

These genome sequences augment the formidable genetic tools that have made Drosophila melanogaster a pre-eminent model for animal genetics, and will further catalyse fundamental research on mechanisms of development, cell biology, genetics, disease, neurobiology, behaviour, physiology and evolution. Despite remarkable similarities among these Drosophila species, we identified many putatively non-neutral changes in protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and cis-regulatory regions.

  Abstract                 = {The human genome encodes the blueprint of life, but the function of the vast majority of its nearly three billion bases is unknown. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

However, recent studies have shown that, in spite of these roles, recombination rates vary tremendously among humans, and show marked differences between humans and closely related species. These findings provide important insights into the determinants of recombination rates and raise new questions about the selective pressures that affect recombination over different genomic scales, with implications for human genetics and evolutionary biology.},

  Abstract                 = {Loci involved in local adaptation can potentially be identified by an unusual correlation between allele frequencies and important ecological variables or by extreme allele frequency differences between geographic regions. However, such comparisons are complicated by differences in sample sizes and the neutral correlation of allele frequencies across populations due to shared history and gene flow. To overcome these difficulties, we have developed a Bayesian method that estimates the empirical pattern of covariance in allele frequencies between populations from a set of markers and then uses this as a null model for a test at individual SNPs. In our model the sample frequencies of an allele across populations are drawn from a set of underlying population frequencies; a transform of these population frequencies is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. We first estimate the covariance matrix of this multivariate normal across loci using a Monte Carlo Markov chain. At each SNP, we then provide a measure of the support, a Bayes factor, for a model where an environmental variable has a linear effect on the transformed allele frequencies compared to a model given by the covariance matrix alone. This test is shown through power simulations to outperform existing correlation tests. We also demonstrate that our method can be used to identify SNPs with unusually large allele frequency differentiation and offers a powerful alternative to tests based on pairwise or global F(ST).

Inference methods can extract part of this information but they require sophisticated statistical techniques that have been made available to the biologist community (through computer programs) only for simple and standard situations typically involving a small number of samples. We propose here a computer program (DIY ABC) for inference based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), in which scenarios can be customized by the user to fit many complex situations involving any number of populations and samples. Such scenarios involve any combination of population divergences, admixtures and population size changes. DIY ABC can be used to compare competing scenarios, estimate parameters for one or more scenarios and compute bias and precision measures for a given scenario and known values of parameters (the current version applies to unlinked microsatellite data). This article describes key methods used in the program and provides its main features. The analysis of one simulated and one real dataset, both with complex evolutionary scenarios, illustrates the main possibilities of DIY ABC.The software DIY ABC is freely available at http://www.montpellier.inra.fr/CBGP/diyabc.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent reports suggest that most of the world's commercial fisheries could collapse within decades. Although poor fisheries governance is often implicated, evaluation of solutions remains rare. Bioeconomic theory and case studies suggest that rights-based catch shares can provide individual incentives for sustainable harvest that is less prone to collapse. To test whether catch-share fishery reforms achieve these hypothetical benefits, we have compiled a global database of fisheries institutions and catch statistics in 11,135 fisheries from 1950 to 2003. Implementation of catch shares halts, and even reverses, the global trend toward widespread collapse. Institutional change has the potential for greatly altering the future of global fisheries.},

We developed a method using species' life-history, catch, and fishery development data to estimate the status of thousands of unassessed fisheries worldwide. We found that small unassessed fisheries are in substantially worse condition than assessed fisheries, but that large unassessed fisheries may be performing nearly as well as their assessed counterparts. Both small and large stocks, however, continue to decline; 64\% of unassessed stocks could provide increased sustainable harvest if rebuilt. Our results suggest that global fishery recovery would simultaneously create increases in abundance (56\%) and fishery yields (8 to 40\%).},

  Abstract                 = {Wing pattern evolution in Heliconius butterflies provides some of the most striking examples of adaptation by natural selection. The genes controlling pattern variation are classic examples of Mendelian loci of large effect, where allelic variation causes large and discrete phenotypic changes and is responsible for both convergent and highly divergent wing pattern evolution across the genus. We characterize nucleotide variation, genotype-by-phenotype associations, linkage disequilibrium (LD), and candidate gene expression patterns across two unlinked genomic intervals that control yellow and red wing pattern variation among mimetic forms of Heliconius erato. Despite very strong natural selection on color pattern, we see neither a strong reduction in genetic diversity nor evidence for extended LD across either patterning interval. This observation highlights the extent that recombination can erase the signature of selection in natural populations and is consistent with the hypothesis that either the adaptive radiation or the alleles controlling it are quite old. However, across both patterning intervals we identified SNPs clustered in several coding regions that were strongly associated with color pattern phenotype. Interestingly, coding regions with associated SNPs were widely separated, suggesting that color pattern alleles may be composed of multiple functional sites, conforming to previous descriptions of these loci as "supergenes." Examination of gene expression levels of genes flanking these regions in both H. erato and its co-mimic, H. melpomene, implicate a gene with high sequence similarity to a kinesin as playing a key role in modulating pattern and provides convincing evidence for parallel changes in gene regulation across co-mimetic lineages. The complex genetic architecture at these color pattern loci stands in marked contrast to the single casual mutations often identified in genetic studies of adaptation, but may be more indicative of the type of genetic changes responsible for much of the adaptive variation found in natural populations. },

  Abstract                 = {Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) is a powerful approach for the identification of differentially expressed genes, providing comprehensive and quantitative gene expression profiles in the form of short tag sequences. Each tag represents a unique transcript, and the relative frequencies of tags in the SAGE library are equal to the relative proportions of the transcripts they represent. One of the major obstacles in the preparation of SAGE libraries from microorganisms is the requirement for large amounts of starting material (i.e., mRNA). Here, we present a novel approach for the construction of SAGE libraries from small quantities of total RNA by using Y linkers to selectively amplify 3' cDNA fragments. To validate this method, we constructed comprehensive gene expression profiles of the toxic dinoflagellate Pfiesteria shumwayae. SAGE libraries were constructed from an actively toxic fish-fed culture of P. shumwayae and from a recently toxic alga-fed culture. P. shumwayae-specific gene transcripts were identified by comparison of tag sequences in the two libraries. Representative tags with frequencies ranging from 0.026 to 3.3\% of the total number of tags in the libraries were chosen for further analysis. Expression of each transcript was confirmed in separate control cultures of toxic P. shumwayae. The modified SAGE method described here produces gene expression profiles that appear to be both comprehensive and quantitative, and it is directly applicable to the study of gene expression in other environmentally relevant microbial species.},

We then evaluated the use of Bayes factors for discovering and genotyping polymorphisms. For polymorphisms that were either previously identified within the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP) or visually evident upon re-inspection of archived ENCODE traces, we observed a false positive rate of 11.3\% using strict thresholds for predicting variants and 69.6\% for lax thresholds. Conversely, false negative rates were 10.8-90.8\%, with false negatives at stricter cut-offs occurring at lower coverage (<10 aligned reads). These results suggest that >90\% of genetic variants are discoverable using multiplexed sequencing provided sufficient coverage at the polymorphic base.},

In contrast to previous studies that focused on immune genes identified in laboratory studies, we centered our analysis on genes that fall within a quantitative trait locus associated with resistance to Plasmodium falciparum in natural populations of A. gambiae. Analyses of haplotypic and genetic diversity at these 28 loci revealed striking differences among populations in levels of genetic diversity and allele frequencies in coding sequence. Putative signals of positive selection were identified at 11 loci, but only one was shared by two subgroups of A. gambiae. Striking patterns of linkage disequilibrium were observed at several loci. We discuss these results with respect to ecological differences among these strata as well as potential implications for disease transmission.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made it possible to address population genetic questions in almost any system, but high error rates associated with such data can introduce significant biases into downstream analyses, necessitating careful experimental design and interpretation in studies based on short-read sequencing. Exploration of population genetic analyses based on NGS has revealed some of the potential biases, but previous work has emphasized parameters relevant to human population genetics and further examination of parameters relevant to other systems is necessary, including situations where sample sizes are small and genetic variation is high. To assess experimental power to address several principal objectives of population genetic studies under these conditions, we simulated population samples under selective sweep, population growth, and population subdivision models and tested the power to accurately infer population genetic parameters from sequence polymorphism data obtained through simulated 4×, 8×, and 15× read depth sequence data. We found that estimates of population genetic differentiation and population growth parameters were systematically biased when inference was based on 4× sequencing, but biases were markedly reduced at even 8× read depth. We also found that the power to identify footprints of positive selection depends on an interaction between read depth and the strength of selection, with strong selection being recovered consistently at all read depths, but weak selection requiring deeper read depths for reliable detection. Although we have explored only a small subset of the many possible experimental designs and population genetic models, using only one SNP-calling approach, our results reveal some general patterns and provide some assessment of what biases could be expected under similar experimental structures.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimates of population size are critical for conservation and management, but accurate estimates are difficult to obtain for many species. Noninvasive genetic methods are increasingly used to estimate population size, particularly in elusive species such as large carnivores, which are difficult to count by most other methods. In most such studies, genotypes are treated simply as unique individual identifiers. Here, we develop a new estimator of population size based on pedigree reconstruction. The estimator accounts for individuals that were directly sampled, individuals that were not sampled but whose genotype could be inferred by pedigree reconstruction, and individuals that were not detected by either of these methods. Monte Carlo simulations show that the population estimate is unbiased and precise if sampling is of sufficient intensity and duration. Simulations also identified sampling conditions that can cause the method to overestimate or underestimate true population size; we present and discuss methods to correct these potential biases. The method detected 2-21\% more individuals than were directly sampled across a broad range of simulated sampling schemes. Genotypes are more than unique identifiers, and the information about relationships in a set of genotypes can improve estimates of population size.},

  Abstract                 = {A remarkable suite of forms of genomic conflict has recently been implicated in speciation. We propose that these diverse roles of genomic conflict in speciation processes can be unified using the concept of 'conflictual speciation'. Conflictual speciation centers on the evolution of reproductive isolation as a byproduct of antagonistic selection among genomic elements with divergent fitness interests. Intragenomic conflicts are expected to readily generate Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities, due to population-specific interactions between opposing elements, and thus they could be especially important in speciation. Moreover, selection from genomic conflicts should be relatively unrelenting across ecological and evolutionary time scales. We explain how intragenomic conflicts can promote, or sometimes constrain, speciation, and describe evidence relating conflicts to the evolution of reproductive isolation.},

Hosts may evolve mechanisms, such as mate preferences, to avoid fitness costs of Wolbachia infection. Despite the potential importance of mate choice for Wolbachia population dynamics, this possibility remains largely unexplored. Here we model the spread of an allele encoding female mate preference for uninfected males alongside the spread of CI inducing Wolbachia. Mate preferences can evolve but the spread of the preference allele depends on factors associated with both Wolbachia infection and the preference allele itself. Incomplete maternal transmission of Wolbachia, fitness costs and low CI, improve the spread of the preference allele and impact on the population dynamics of Wolbachia. In addition, mate preferences are found in infected individuals. These results have important consequences for the fate of Wolbachia and studies addressing mate preferences in infected populations.},

They also include guidelines for inferential interpretation of the overlap of CIs on independent group means.

The statistic is simple, intuitive, and easily calculated. It has a normalized range to facilitate comparisons among different groups, trees, or studies and it provides information on individual groups rather than a composite measure for all groups. It naturally handles polytomies and accommodates measures of uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships. We use coalescent simulations to explore the behavior of the gsi across a range of divergence times, with the mean value increasing to 1, the maximum value when exclusivity within a group reached monophyly. Simulations also demonstrate that the power to reject the null hypothesis of mixed genealogical ancestry increased markedly as sample size increased, and that the gsi provides a statistically more powerful measure of divergence than FST. Applications to data from published studies demonstrated that the gsi provides a useful way to detect significant exclusivity even when groups are not monophyletic. Although we describe this statistic in the context of divergence, it is more broadly applicable to quantify and assess the significance of clustering of observations in labeled groups on any tree.},

The linear relationship that was found indicates that the large differences in GC level of third codon positions of human genes are paralleled by smaller differences in GC levels of first and second codon positions. Whereas third codon position differences correspond to very large differences in codon usage within the human genome, the first and second codon position differences correspond to smaller, yet very remarkable, differences in the amino acid composition of encoded proteins. Because GC levels of codon positions are linearly correlated with the GC levels of the isochores harboring the corresponding genes, both codon usage and amino acid composition are different for proteins encoded by genes located in isochores of different GC levels. Furthermore, we have also shown that a linear relationship with a unit slope and a correlation coefficient of 0.77 exists between GC levels of introns and exons from the 238 human genes currently available for this analysis. Introns are, however, about 5\% lower in GC, on average, than exons from the same genes.},

  Abstract                 = {Can speciation occur in a single population when different types of resources are available, in the absence of any geographical isolation, or any spatial or temporal variation in selection? The controversial topics of sympatric speciation and ecological speciation have already stimulated many theoretical studies, most of them agreeing on the fact that mechanisms generating disruptive selection, some level of assortment, and enough heterogeneity in the available resources, are critical for sympatric speciation to occur. Few studies, however, have combined the three factors and investigated their interactions. In this article, I analytically derive conditions for sympatric speciation in a general model where the distribution of resources can be uni- or bimodal, and where a parameter controls the range of resources that an individual can exploit. This approach bridges the gap between models of a unimodal continuum of resources and Levene-type models with discrete resources. I then test these conditions against simulation results from a recently published article (Thibert-Plante & Hendry, 2011, J. Evol. Biol. 24: 2186â2196) and confirm that sympatric ecological speciation is favoured when (i) selection is disruptive (i.e. individuals with an intermediate trait are at a local fitness minimum), (ii) resources are differentiated enough and (iii) mating is assortative. I also discuss the role of mating preference functions and the need (or lack thereof) for bimodality in resource distributions for diversification.},

  Abstract                 = {Many dynamical systems, including lakes, organisms, ocean circulation patterns, or financial markets, are now thought to have tipping points where critical transitions to a contrasting state can happen. Because critical transitions can occur unexpectedly and are difficult to manage, there is a need for methods that can be used to identify when a critical transition is approaching. Recent theory shows that we can identify the proximity of a system to a critical transition using a variety of so-called 'early warning signals', and successful empirical examples suggest a potential for practical applicability. However, while the range of proposed methods for predicting critical transitions is rapidly expanding, opinions on their practical use differ widely, and there is no comparative study that tests the limitations of the different methods to identify approaching critical transitions using time-series data. Here, we summarize a range of currently available early warning methods and apply them to two simulated time series that are typical of systems undergoing a critical transition. In addition to a methodological guide, our work offers a practical toolbox that may be used in a wide range of fields to help detect early warning signals of critical transitions in time series data.},

We demonstrate how this approach provides testable hypotheses about the causal links among levels of biological organization, and assists in designing relevant experiments to test the effects of genetic variation on phenotype, whole-organism performance capabilities and fitness. We review some of the research programs that have incorporated mechanistic approaches when examining naturally occurring genetic and phenotypic variation and use these examples to highlight the value of developing a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between genotype and fitness. We give suggestions to guide future research aimed at uncovering and understanding the genetic basis of adaptation and argue that further integration of mechanistic approaches will help molecular ecologists better understand the evolution of natural populations.},

  Abstract                 = {It is becoming increasingly clear that local adaptation can occur even in the face of high gene flow and limited overall genomic differentiation among populations (reviewed by Nosil et al. 2009). Thus, one important task for molecular ecologists is to sift through genomic data to identify the genes that matter for local adaptation (Hoffmann & Willi 2008; Stapley et al. 2010). Recent advances in high-throughput molecular technologies have facilitated this search, and a variety of approaches can be applied, including those grounded in population genetics [e.g. outlier analysis (Pavlidis et al. 2008)], classical and quantitative genetics [e.g. quantitative trait locus analysis (MacKay et al. 2009)], and cellular and molecular biology [e.g. transcriptomics (Larsen et al. 2011)]. However, applying these approaches in nonmodel organisms that lack extensive genetic and genomic resources has been a formidable challenge. In this issue, Papakostas et al. (2012). demonstrate how one such approach ? high-throughput label-free proteomics (reviewed by Gstaiger & Aebersold 2009; Domon & Aebersold 2010) ? can be applied to detect genes that may be involved in local adaptation in a species with limited genomic resources. Using this approach, they identified genes that may be implicated in local adaptation to salinity in European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus L.) and provide insight into the mechanisms by which fish cope with changes in this critically important environmental parameter.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: As the developmental costs of genomic tools decline, genomic approaches to non-model systems are becoming more feasible. Many of these systems may lack advanced genetic tools but are extremely valuable models in other biological fields. Here we report the development of expressed sequence tags (EST's) in an orthopteroid insect, a model for the study of neurobiology, speciation, and evolution. RESULTS: We report the sequencing of 14,502 EST's from clones derived from a nerve cord cDNA library, and the subsequent construction of a Gene Index from these sequences, from the Hawaiian trigonidiine cricket Laupala kohalensis. The Gene Index contains 8607 unique sequences comprised of 2575 tentative consensus (TC) sequences and 6032 singletons. For each of the unique sequences, an attempt was made to assign a provisional annotation and to categorize its function using a Gene Ontology-based classification through a sequence-based comparison to known proteins. In addition, a set of unique 70 base pair oligomers that can be used for DNA microarrays was developed. All Gene Index information is posted at the DFCI Gene Indices web page CONCLUSION: Orthopterans are models used to understand the neurophysiological basis of complex motor patterns such as flight and stridulation. The sequences presented in the cricket Gene Index will provide neurophysiologists with many genetic tools that have been largely absent in this field. The cricket Gene Index is one of only two gene indices to be developed in an evolutionary model system. Species within the genus Laupala have speciated recently, rapidly, and extensively. Therefore, the genes identified in the cricket Gene Index can be used to study the genomics of speciation. Furthermore, this gene index represents a significant EST resources for basal insects. As such, this resource is a valuable comparative tool for the understanding of invertebrate molecular evolution. The sequences presented here will provide much needed genomic resources for three distinct but overlapping fields of inquiry: neurobiology, speciation, and molecular evolution.},

As with other sequencing-by-synthesis methods, RAD-Seq produces stochastic count data and requires sensitive analysis to develop or genotype markers accurately. We show that there are several sources of bias specific to RAD-Seq that are not explicitly addressed by current genotyping tools, namely restriction fragment bias, restriction site heterozygosity and PCR GC content bias. We explore the performance of existing analysis tools given these biases and discuss approaches to limiting or handling biases in RAD-Seq data. While these biases need to be taken seriously, we believe RAD loci affected by them can be excluded or processed with relative ease in most cases and that most RAD loci will be accurately genotyped by existing tools.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a new approach to create microsatellite primer sets that have high utility across a wide range of species. The success of this method was demonstrated using birds. We selected 35 avian EST microsatellite loci that had a high degree of sequence homology between the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata and the chicken Gallus gallus and designed primer sets in which the primer bind sites were identical in both species. For 33 conserved primer sets, on average, 100% of loci amplified in each of 17 passerine species and 99% of loci in five non-passerine species. The genotyping of four individuals per species revealed that 24‚Äì76% (mean 48%) of loci were polymorphic in the passerines and 18‚Äì26% (mean 21%) in the non-passerines. When at least 17 individuals were genotyped per species for four Fringillidae finch species, 71‚Äì85% of loci were polymorphic, observed heterozygosity was above 0.50 for most loci and no locus deviated significantly from Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg proportions.This new set of microsatellite markers is of higher cross-species utility than any set previously designed. The loci described are suitable for a range of applications that require polymorphic avian markers, including paternity and population studies. They will facilitate comparisons of bird genome organization, including genome mapping and studies of recombination, and allow comparisons of genetic variability between species whilst avoiding ascertainment bias. The costs and time to develop new loci can now be avoided for many applications in numerous species. Furthermore, our method can be readily used to develop microsatellite markers of high utility across other taxa.},

  Abstract                 = {Inheritance-the influence of ancestors on the phenotypes of their descendants-translates natural selection into evolutionary change. For the past century, inheritance has been conceptualized almost exclusively as the transmission of DNA sequence variation from parents to offspring in accordance with Mendelian rules, but advances in cell and developmental biology have now revealed a rich array of inheritance mechanisms. This empirical evidence calls for a unified conception of inheritance that combines genetic and nongenetic mechanisms and encompasses the known range of transgenerational effects, including the transmission of genetic and epigenetic variation, the transmission of plastic phenotypes (acquired traits), and the effects of parental environment and genotype on offspring phenotype. We propose a unified theoretical framework based on the Price equation that can be used to model evolution under an expanded inheritance concept that combines the effects of genetic and nongenetic inheritance. To illustrate the utility and generality of this framework, we show how it can be applied to a variety of scenarios, including nontransmissible environmental noise, maternal effects, indirect genetic effects, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, RNA-mediated inheritance, and cultural inheritance.},

  Abstract                 = {Global climate change is projected to accelerate during the next century, altering oceanic patterns in temperature, pH and oxygen concentrations. Documenting patterns of genetic adaptation to these variables in locations that currently experience geographic variation in them is an important tool in understanding the potential for natural selection to allow populations to adapt as climate change proceeds. We sequenced the mantle transcriptome of 39 red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) individuals from three regions (Monterey Bay, Sonoma, north of Cape Mendocino) distinct in temperature, aragonite saturation, exposure to hypoxia and disease pressure along the California coast. Among 1.17 × 10(6) Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in this study (1.37\% of the transcriptome), 21 579 could be genotyped for all individuals. A principal components analysis concluded that the vast majority of SNPs show no population structure from Monterey, California to the Oregon border, in corroboration with several previous studies. In contrast, an FST outlier analysis indicated 691 SNPs as exhibiting significantly higher than expected differentiation (experiment-wide P < 0.05). From these, it was possible to identify 163 genes through BLAST annotation, 34 of which contained more than one outlier SNP. A large number of these genes are involved in biomineralization, energy metabolism, heat-, disease- or hypoxia-tolerance. These genes are candidate loci for spatial adaptation to geographic variation that is likely to increase in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {DNA metabarcoding enables efficient characterization of species composition in environmental DNA or bulk biodiversity samples, and this approach is making significant and unique contributions in the field of ecology. In metabarcoding of animals, the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene is frequently used as the marker of choice because no other genetic region can be found in taxonomically verified databases with sequences covering so many taxa. However, the accuracy of metabarcoding datasets is dependent on recovery of the targeted taxa using conserved amplification primers. We argue that COI does not contain suitably conserved regions for most amplicon-based metabarcoding applications. Marker selection deserves increased scrutiny and available marker choices should be broadened in order to maximize potential in this exciting field of research.},

Inclusion of such variation is important for continued progress in ecological and evolutionary theory. We provide a conceptual basis for IBMs by describing five major types of individual variation in IBMs: spatial, ontogenetic, phenotypic, cognitive, and genetic. IBMs are now used in almost all subfields of ecology and evolutionary biology. We map those subfields and look more closely at selected key papers on fish recruitment, forest dynamics, sympatric speciation, metapopulation dynamics, maintenance of diversity, and species conservation. Theorists are currently divided on whether IBMs represent only a practical tool for extending classical theory to more complex situations, or whether individual-based theory represents a radically new research program. We feel that the tension between these two poles of thinking can be a source of creativity in ecology and evolutionary theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Mate choice and mate competition can both influence the evolution of sexual isolation between populations. Assortative mating may arise if traits and preferences diverge in step, and, alternatively, mate competition may counteract mating preferences and decrease assortative mating. Here, we examine potential assortative mating between populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura that have experimentally evolved under either increased (‚Äòpolyandry‚Äô) or decreased (‚Äòmonogamy‚Äô) sexual selection intensity for 100 generations. These populations have evolved differences in numerous traits, including a male signal and female preference traits. We use a two males: one female design, allowing both mate choice and competition to influence mating outcomes, to test for assortative mating between our populations. Mating latency shows subtle effects of male and female interactions, with females from the monogamous populations appearing reluctant to mate with males from the polyandrous populations. However, males from the polyandrous populations have a significantly higher probability of mating regardless of the female's population. Our results suggest that if populations differ in the intensity of sexual selection, effects on mate competition may overcome mate choice.},

  Abstract                 = {Because of the stochastic way in which lineages sort during speciation, gene trees may differ in topology from each other and from species trees. Surprisingly, assuming that genetic lineages follow a coalescent model of within-species evolution, we find that for any species tree topology with five or more species, there exist branch lengths for which gene tree discordance is so common that the most likely gene tree topology to evolve along the branches of a species tree differs from the species phylogeny. This counterintuitive result implies that in combining data on multiple loci, the straightforward procedure of using the most frequently observed gene tree topology as an estimate of the species tree topology can be asymptotically guaranteed to produce an incorrect estimate. We conclude with suggestions that can aid in overcoming this new obstacle to accurate genomic inference of species phylogenies.},

  Abstract                 = {Inherent incompatibilities between genetic components from genomes of different species may cause intrinsic reproductive isolation. In evolution experiments designed to instigate speciation in laboratory populations of the filamentous fungus Neurospora, we previously discovered a pair of incompatibility loci (dfe and dma) that interact negatively to cause severe defects in sexual reproduction. Here we show that the dfe-dma incompatibility also is a significant cause of genetic isolation between two naturally occurring species of Neurospora (N. crassa and N. intermedia). The strong incompatibility interaction has a simple genetic basis (two biallelic loci) and antagonistic epistasis occurs between heterospecific alleles only, consistent with the DobzhanskyâMuller model of genic incompatibility. We developed microarray-based, restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) markers that identified â¼1500 polymorphisms between the genomes of the two species, and constructed the first interspecific physical map of Neurospora. With this new mapping resource, the approximate genomic locations of the incompatibility loci were determined using three different approaches: genome scanning, bulk-segregant analyses, and introgression. These population, quantitative, and classical genetics methods concordantly identified two candidate regions, narrowing the search for each incompatibility locus to only â¼2% of the nuclear genome. This study demonstrates how advances in high-throughput, genome-wide genotyping can be applied to mapping reproductive isolation genes and speciation research.},

An outstanding question is how to use these technologies efficiently to identify genes affecting liability to complex disorders. To achieve this goal, we propose a statistical method that has several optimal properties: It can be used with case control data and yet, like family-based designs, controls for population heterogeneity; it is insensitive to the usual violations of model assumptions, such as cases failing to be strictly independent; and, by using Bayesian outlier methods, it circumvents the need for Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, leading to better performance in many settings while still constraining risk for false positives. The performance of our genomic control method is quite good for plausible effects of liability genes, which bodes well for future genetic analyses of complex disorders.},

  Abstract                 = {A new and highly effective method, termed suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), has been developed for the generation of subtracted cDNA libraries. It is based primarily on a recently described technique called suppression PCR and combines normalization and subtraction in a single procedure. The normalization step equalizes the abundance of cDNAs within the target population and the subtraction step excludes the common sequences between the target and driver populations. In a model system, the SSH technique enriched for rare sequences over 1,000-fold in one round of subtractive hybridization. We demonstrate its usefulness by generating a testis-specific cDNA library and by using the subtracted cDNA mixture as a hybridization probe to identify homologous sequences in a human Y chromosome cosmid library. The human DNA inserts in the isolated cosmids were further confirmed to be expressed in a testis-specific manner. These results suggest that the SSH technique is applicable to many molecular genetic and positional cloning studies for the identification of disease, developmental, tissue-specific, or other differentially expressed genes.},

Forensic samples are particularly prone to such damage due to their prolonged exposure after deposition at crime scenes or mass disasters. Current methods for typing such samples rely heavily on the intact \{DNA\} template, and can be adversely affected by damage that is present. Proposed solutions center around increased access to the smaller remaining fragments and/or increased sensitivity. However, all rely on the polymerase chain reaction to copy the starting material; the required polymerase can be impeded by certain types of damage such as dimer-formation after ultraviolet light exposure, resulting in stochastic effects that can complicate interpretation. In vitro repair of such damage offers the ability to generate high quality profiles using traditional methods without changes to the current amplification reagents or conditions. Typically, repair reactions required large quantities of starting material and a separate repair reaction. Forensic samples, however, usually consist of small quantities, and quality control measures necessitate laboratory procedures that minimize sample manipulation. Here, an optimized protocol for forensic application of the PreCR‚Ñ¢ Repair Mix to current typing methods is demonstrated for samples damaged by ultraviolet light exposure.},

Starting from there, the species colonized the rest of the world after the last glaciation about 10 000 years ago. Consistent with this demographic scenario, African populations have been shown to harbour higher levels of microsatellite and sequence variation than cosmopolitan populations. Nevertheless, limited information is available on the genetic structure of African populations. We used X chromosomal microsatellite variation to study the population structure of D. melanogaster populations using 13 sampling sites in North, West and East Africa. These populations were compared to six European and one North American population. Significant population structure was found among African D. melanogaster populations. Using a Bayesian method for inferring population structure we detected two distinct groups of populations among African D. melanogaster. Interestingly, the comparison to cosmopolitan D. melanogaster populations indicated that one of the divergent African groups is closely related to cosmopolitan flies. Low, but significant levels of differentiation were observed for sub-Saharan D. melanogaster populations from West and East Africa.},

Such results suggest that genetic variance located within the cytoplasm might be of evolutionary importance and potentially involved in shaping population evolutionary trajectories. As a step towards assessing this assertion, here we conduct a formal meta-analytic review to quantitatively assess the extent to which cytoplasmic genetic effects contribute to phenotypic expression across animal and plant kingdoms. We report that cytoplasmic effect sizes are generally moderate in size and associated with variation across a range of factors. Specifically, cytoplasmic effects on morphological traits are generally larger than those on life history or metabolic traits. Cytoplasmic effect sizes estimated at the between-species scale (via interspecies mix-and-matching of cytoplasmic and nuclear genomes) are larger than those at the within-species scale. Furthermore, cytoplasmic effects tied to epistatic interactions with the nuclear genome tend to be stronger than additive cytoplasmic effects, at least when restricting the data set to gonochorous animal species. Our results thus confirm that cytoplasmic genetic variation is commonly tied to phenotypic expression across plants and animals, implicate the cytoplasmic-nuclear interaction as a key unit on which natural selection acts and generally suggest that the genetic variation that lies within the cytoplasm is likely to be entwined in adaptive evolutionary processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Novel sequencing technologies permit the rapid production of large sequence data sets. These technologies are likely to revolutionize genetics and biomedical research, but a thorough characterization of the ultra-short read output is necessary. We generated and analyzed two Illumina 1G ultra-short read data sets, i.e. 2.8 million 27mer reads from a Beta vulgaris genomic clone and 12.3 million 36mers from the Helicobacter acinonychis genome. We found that error rates range from 0.3\% at the beginning of reads to 3.8\% at the end of reads. Wrong base calls are frequently preceded by base G. Base substitution error frequencies vary by 10- to 11-fold, with A > C transversion being among the most frequent and C > G transversions among the least frequent substitution errors. Insertions and deletions of single bases occur at very low rates. When simulating re-sequencing we found a 20-fold sequencing coverage to be sufficient to compensate errors by correct reads. The read coverage of the sequenced regions is biased; the highest read density was found in intervals with elevated GC content. High Solexa quality scores are over-optimistic and low scores underestimate the data quality. Our results show different types of biases and ways to detect them. Such biases have implications on the use and interpretation of Solexa data, for de novo sequencing, re-sequencing, the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms and DNA methylation sites, as well as for transcriptome analysis.},

These factors, especially when occurring in tandem, can lead to an increased risk of extinction. To examine the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation we selected an isolated population of a sedentary woodland specialist species (Rhinolophus hipposideros) to act as an indicator of disruptions to landscape level connectivity. Based on 491 individuals from 37 colonies our results revealed the presence of a broad North-Range/South-Range differentiation within this species in Ireland; a finding supported across datasets (mtDNA and nuclear microsatellites) and analyses. Analyses of echolocation data and microsatellites suggested further differentiation of the northern-most colonies. A landscape genetics framework to assess the impact of habitat versus geographic distance on population differentiation showed that habitat features (at a five km resolution) were equally likely to be correlated with differentiation as geographic distance considered alone. Further differentiation of the geographically disjunct groups is likely to occur in the future. The viability of either group alone is uncertain given their restricted distribution, small population sizes (based on census data and Ne estimates) and isolation. Roost provision and habitat restoration in the geographic region separating the differentiated groups will be fundamental to the recolonization of this area and the reestablishment of connectivity between the regional groups.

  Abstract                 = {Ecological speciation is considered an adaptive response to selection for local adaptation. However, besides suitable ecological conditions, the process requires assortative mating to protect the nascent species from homogenization by gene flow. By means of a simple model, we demonstrate that disruptive ecological selection favors the evolution of sexual preferences for ornaments that signal local adaptation. Such preferences induce assortative mating with respect to ecological characters and enhance the strength of disruptive selection. Natural and sexual selection thus work in concert to achieve local adaptation and reproductive isolation, even in the presence of substantial gene flow. The resulting speciation process ensues without the divergence of mating preferences, avoiding problems that have plagued previous models of speciation by sexual selection.},

The existence of this sexual conflict has long been acknowledged, but its consequences have not been fully investigated. By applying adaptive dynamics methods and individual-based computer simulations to a standard model for good-genes sexual selection, we show that sexual conflict over condition-dependent signaling can prevent the handicap process from ever attaining an evolutionary equilibrium. We outline the parameter conditions and properties of the underlying genetics conducive to nonequilibrium behavior and discuss the potential of such behavior to explain the elaboration and frequent phylogenetic loss of sexually selected traits. We also evaluate its consequences for well-established insights of sexual selection theory previously shown to apply when female mating preference and male ornament expression do converge on stable equilibrium levels. Contrary to equilibrium expectation, a continual change of condition-dependent signaling enables the evolution of a costly preference for a pure epistatic indicator and the evolution of preferences for redundant signals or a large number of independent ornaments. We thus conclude that seemingly general results of sexual selection theory, insofar as these are based on equilibrium considerations, do not extend to cases where nonequilibrium behavior occurs.},

We try to gain insight into the dynamics of this rapid evolution and its underlying mechanisms by means of a simple theoretical model. In the model, sexual selection and sympatric speciation act together in order to drive rapid divergence of gamete recognition proteins. In this process, intraspecific competition for fertilizations enlarges male gamete protein variation by means of evolutionary branching, which initiates sympatric speciation. In addition, avoidance of competition for fertilizations between the incipient species drives the rapid evolution of gamete recognition proteins. This mechanism can account for both strong stabilizing selection on gamete recognition proteins within species and rapid divergence between species. Moreover, it can explain the empirical finding that the rate of divergence of fertilization genes is not constant, but highest between closely related species.},

  Abstract                 = {Theory indicates that numbers of mating types should tend towards infinity or remain at two. The social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, however, has three mating types. It is therefore a mystery how this species has broken the threshold of two mating types, but has not increased towards a much higher number. Frequency-dependent selection on rare types in combination with isogamy, a form of reproduction involving gametes similar in size, could explain the evolution of multiple mating types in this system. Other factors, such as drift, may be preventing the evolution of more than three. We first looked for evidence of isogamy by measuring gamete size associated with each type. We found no evidence of size dissimilarities between gametes. We then looked for evidence of balancing selection, by examining mating type distributions in natural populations and comparing genetic differentiation at the mating type locus to that at more neutral loci. We found that mating type frequency varied among the three populations we examined, with only one of the three showing an even sex ratio, which does not support balancing selection. However, we found more population structure at neutral loci than the mating type locus, suggesting that the three mating types are indeed maintained at intermediate frequencies by balancing selection. Overall, the data are consistent with balancing selection acting on D.¬†discoideum mating types, but with a sufficiently weak rare sex advantage to allow for drift, a potential explanation for why these amoebae have only three mating types.},

The profound effects of polyploidy on gene expression appear to be caused more by hybridity than by genome doubling. Epigenetic mechanisms underlying genome-wide changes in expression are as yet poorly understood; only methylation has received much study, and its importance varies among polyploids. Genetic diploidization begins with the earliest responses to genome merger and doubling; less is known about chromosomal diploidization. Polyploidy duplicates every gene in the genome, providing the raw material for divergence or partitioning of function in homoeologous copies. Preferential retention or loss of genes occurs in a wide range of taxa, suggesting that there is an underlying set of principles governing the fates of duplicated genes.

Consequently, similarities in colour patterns are not always correlated with common ancestry, but may result from convergent evolution under shared selection pressures or drift. Neolamprologus brichardi and Neolamprologus pulcher have been described as two distinct species based on differences in the arrangement of two dark bars on the operculum. Our study uses DNA sequences of the mitochondrial control region to show that relatedness of haplotypes disagrees with species assignment based on head colour pattern. This suggests repeated parallel evolution of particular stripe patterns. The complete lack of shared haplotypes between populations of the same or different phenotypes reflects strong philopatric behaviour, possibly induced by the cooperative breeding mode in which offspring remain in their natal territory and serve as helpers until they disperse to nearby territories or take over a breeding position. Concordant phylogeographic patterns between N. brichardi/N. pulcher populations and other rock-dwelling cichlids suggest that the same colonization routes have been taken by sympatric species and that these routes were affected by lake level fluctuations in the past.},

In this paper, we present a test for ancient admixture that exploits the asymmetry in the frequencies of the two nonconcordant gene trees in a three-population tree. This test was first applied to detect interbreeding between Neandertals and modern humans. We derive the analytic expectation of a test statistic, called the D statistic, which is sensitive to asymmetry under alternative demographic scenarios. We show that the D statistic is insensitive to some demographic assumptions such as ancestral population sizes and requires only the assumption that the ancestral populations were randomly mating. An important aspect of D statistics is that they can be used to detect archaic admixture even when no archaic sample is available. We explore the effect of sequencing error on the false-positive rate of the test for admixture, and we show how to estimate the proportion of archaic ancestry in the genomes of present-day populations. We also investigate a model of subdivision in ancestral populations that can result in D statistics that indicate recent admixture.},

  Abstract                 = {Inferring the history of isolation and gene flow during species differentiation can inform us on the processes underlying their formation. Following their recent expansion in Europe, two subspecies of the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus and Mus musculus musculus) have formed a hybrid zone maintained by hybrid incompatibilities and possibly behavioural reinforcement, offering a good model of incipient speciation. We reconstruct the history of their divergence using an approximate Bayesian computation framework and sequence variation at 57 autosomal loci. We find support for a long isolation period preceding the advent of gene flow around 200,000 generations ago, much before the formation of the European hybrid zone a few thousand years ago. The duration of the allopatric episode appears long enough (74\% of divergence time) to explain the accumulation of many post-zygotic incompatibilities expressed in the present hybrid zone. The ancient contact inferred could have played a role in mating behaviour divergence and laid the ground for further reinforcement. We suggest that both subspecies originally colonized the Middle East from the northern Indian subcontinent, domesticus settling on the shores of the Persian Gulf and musculus on those of the Caspian Sea. Range expansions during interglacials would have induced secondary contacts, presumably in Iran, where they must have also interacted with Mus musculus castaneus. Future studies should incorporate this possibility, and we point to Iran and its surroundings as a hot spot for house mouse diversity and speciation studies.},

Novel haplotype aware assessments of coverage, contiguity, structure, base calling, and copy number were made. We establish that within this benchmark: (1) It is possible to assemble the genome to a high level of coverage and accuracy, and that (2) large differences exist between the assemblies, suggesting room for further improvements in current methods.

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Restriction-site–associated genomic markers are a powerful tool for investigating evolutionary questions at the population level, but are limited in their utility at deeper phylogenetic scales where fewer orthologous loci are typically recovered across disparate taxa. While this limitation stems in part from mutations to restriction recognition sites that disrupt data generation, an additional source of data loss comes from the failure to identify homology during bioinformatic analyses. Clustering methods that allow for lower similarity thresholds and the inclusion of indel variation will perform better at assembling RADseq loci at the phylogenetic scale.Results: PyRAD is a pipeline to assemble de novo RADseq loci with the aim of optimizing coverage across phylogenetic datasets. It uses a wrapper around an alignment-clustering algorithm, which allows for indel variation within and between samples, as well as for incomplete overlap among reads (e.g. paired-end). Here I compare PyRAD with the program Stacks in their performance analyzing a simulated RADseq dataset that includes indel variation. Indels disrupt clustering of homologous loci in Stacks but not in PyRAD, such that the latter recovers more shared loci across disparate taxa. I show through reanalysis of an empirical RADseq dataset that indels are a common feature of such data, even at shallow phylogenetic scales. PyRAD uses parallel processing as well as an optional hierarchical clustering method, which allows it to rapidly assemble phylogenetic datasets with hundreds of sampled individuals.Availability: Software is written in Python and freely available at http://www.dereneaton.com/software/Contact: daeaton.chicago@gmail.comSupplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  Abstract                 = {Phylogenetic relationships among recently diverged species are often difficult to resolve due to insufficient phylogenetic signal in available markers and/or conflict among gene trees. Here we explore the use of reduced-representation genome sequencing, specifically in the form of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD), for phylogenetic inference and the detection of ancestral hybridization in non-model organisms. As a case study, we investigate Pedicularis section Cyathophora, a systematically recalcitrant clade of flowering plants in the broomrape family (Orobanchaceae). Two methods of phylogenetic inference, maximum likelihood and Bayesian concordance, were applied to data sets that included as many as 40,000 RAD loci. Both methods yielded similar topologies that included two major clades: a "rex-thamnophila" clade, composed of two species and several subspecies with relatively low floral diversity, and geographically widespread distributions at lower elevations, and a "superba" clade, composed of three species characterized by relatively high floral diversity and isolated geographic distributions at higher elevations. Levels of molecular divergence between subspecies in the rex-thamnophila clade are similar to those between species in the superba clade. Using Patterson's D-statistic test, including a novel extension of the method that enables finer-grained resolution of introgression among multiple candidate taxa by removing the effect of their shared ancestry, we detect significant introgression among nearly all taxa in the rex-thamnophila clade, but not between clades or among taxa within the superba clade. These results suggest an important role for geographic isolation in the emergence of species barriers, by facilitating local adaptation and differentiation in the absence of homogenizing gene flow.},

  Abstract                 = {Biological sequence data is accumulating rapidly, motivating the development of improved high-throughput methods for sequence classification.UBLAST and USEARCH are new algorithms enabling sensitive local and global search of large sequence databases at exceptionally high speeds. They are often orders of magnitude faster than BLAST in practical applications, though sensitivity to distant protein relationships is lower. UCLUST is a new clustering method that exploits USEARCH to assign sequences to clusters. UCLUST offers several advantages over the widely used program CD-HIT, including higher speed, lower memory use, improved sensitivity, clustering at lower identities and classification of much larger datasets.Binaries are available at no charge for non-commercial use at http://www.drive5.com/usearch.},
  Comment                  = {This is an interesting programme. It employs a rather simple and heuristic filtering algorithm based on k-mers, but it allows much higher distances without, so it seems (no experimental test), exponential increase of running time with increased distance threshold. Distance (identity) is calculated with NW like algorithm, i. e. allowing for gaps. Clustering is done by comparision to canonical sequences of each cluster, which are the first reads in the input file. The input file should therefore be sorted, by read count for example. This clustering is identical to the sphere clustering in starcode. Part of Usearch.},

Undetected chimeras may be misinterpreted as novel species, causing inflated estimates of diversity and spurious inferences of differences between populations. Detection and removal of chimeras is therefore of critical importance in such experiments.We describe UCHIME, a new program that detects chimeric sequences with two or more segments. UCHIME either uses a database of chimera-free sequences or detects chimeras de novo by exploiting abundance data. UCHIME has better sensitivity than ChimeraSlayer (previously the most sensitive database method), especially with short, noisy sequences. In testing on artificial bacterial communities with known composition, UCHIME de novo sensitivity is shown to be comparable to Perseus.

  Abstract                 = {The recent, unexpected discovery of a functional DNA methylation system in the genome of the social bee Apis mellifera underscores the potential importance of DNA methylation in invertebrates. The extent of genomic DNA methylation and its role in A. mellifera remain unknown, however. Here we show that genes in A. mellifera can be divided into 2 distinct classes, one with low-CpG dinucleotide content and the other with high-CpG dinucleotide content. This dichotomy is explained by the gradual depletion of CpG dinucleotides, a well-known consequence of DNA methylation. The loss of CpG dinucleotides associated with DNA methylation also may explain the unusual mutational patterns seen in A. mellifera that lead to AT-rich regions of the genome. A detailed investigation of this dichotomy implicates DNA methylation in A. mellifera development. High-CpG genes, which are predicted to be hypomethylated in germlines, are enriched with functions associated with developmental processes, whereas low-CpG genes, predicted to be hypermethylated in germlines, are enriched with functions associated with basic biological processes. Furthermore, genes more highly expressed in one caste than another are overrepresented among high-CpG genes. Our results highlight the potential significance of epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, in developmental processes in social insects. In particular, the pervasiveness of DNA methylation in the genome of A. mellifera provides fertile ground for future studies of phenotypic plasticity and genomic imprinting.},

The method depends on genetic diversity being markedly lower within than between species. Closely related species are most likely to share genetic variation in communities where speciation rates are rapid and effective population sizes are large, such that coalescence times are long. We assessed the applicability of DNA barcoding (here the 5' half of the cytochrome c oxidase I) to a diverse community of butterflies from the upper Amazon, using a group with a well-established morphological taxonomy to serve as a reference. Only 77\% of species could be accurately identified using the barcode data, a figure that dropped to 68\% in species represented in the analyses by more than one geographical race and at least one congener. The use of additional mitochondrial sequence data hardly improved species identification, while a fragment of a nuclear gene resolved issues in some of the problematic species. We acknowledge the utility of barcodes when morphological characters are ambiguous or unknown, but we also recommend the addition of nuclear sequence data, and caution that species-level identification rates might be lower in the most diverse habitats of our planet.},

They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty. },

SSRs were more densely distributed and contained longer repeat structures in BAC library-derived sequence than in EST library-derived sequence, although neither repeat density nor length was exceptionally elevated despite the relatively large genome size of Laupala. A non-random distribution favoring AT-rich SSRs was observed. Allelic diversity of SSRs was positively correlated with repeat length and was generally higher in AT-rich repeat motifs.The first large-scale survey of Orthopteran SSR allelic diversity is presented. Selection contributes more strongly to the size and density distributions of SSR loci derived from EST library sequence than from BAC library sequence, although all SSRs likely are subject to similar physical and structural constraints, such as slippage of DNA replication machinery, that may generate increased allelic diversity in AT-rich sequence motifs. Although in silico approaches work well for SSR locus identification in both EST and BAC libraries, BAC library sequence and AT-rich repeat motifs are generally superior SSR development resources for most applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Sexual behaviours often evolve rapidly and are critical for sexual isolation. We suggest that coordinated sexual signals and preferences generate stabilizing selection, favouring the accumulation of many small-effect mutations in sexual communication traits. Rapid radiation of a sexual behaviour used in signalling, song pulse rate, has been observed in the Hawaiian cricket genus Laupala. Using marker-assisted introgression, we isolated five known quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing species-level differences in pulse rate from one species, L. paranigra, into a closely related species, L. kohalensis. All five QTL were found to have a significant effect on song and appear to be largely additive in backcross introgression lines. Furthermore, all effect sizes were small in magnitude. Our data provide support for the hypothesis that stabilizing selection on sexual signals in Laupala creates genetic conditions favourable to incremental divergence during speciation, through the evolution of alleles of minor rather than major phenotypic effects.},

  Abstract                 = {The biogeography of speciation remains a controversial issue and the process of allopatric speciation reigns. Sympatric speciation differs from allopatric speciation in terms of geographic setting and the role of selection in bringing about reproductive isolating mechanisms, making it a particularly fascinating and controversial subject for evolutionary biologists. Mayr (1947) explained the difference eloquently: for allopatric speciation, populations spatially diverge and then become reproductively isolated; for sympatric speciation, populations first become reproductively isolated and then diverge. Because of this, sympatric speciation is difficult to show empirically and most evolutionary biologists agree that strict ecological, evolutionary, and geographic criteria must be met (Coyne & Orr 2004). In this issue, Crow etÂ al. (2010) challenge us to expand the definition of sympatric speciation by studying species of marine fishes that they propose have arisen by sympatric speciation in a setting that does not appear to conform to the usual geographical criteria.},

  Abstract                 = { <p>Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of DNA sequencing down to the point that genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs). This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity. The GBS procedure is demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated as dominant markers. Future application of GBS to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species.</p> },

High-throughput, second-generation sequencing approaches are being applied to organisms based on their interesting ecological, physiological, developmental, or evolutionary properties and not on the depth of genetic information available for them. Here, we illustrate this point using a low-cost, efficient technique to determine the fine-scale phylogenetic relationships among recently diverged populations in a species. This application of restriction site-associated DNA tags (RAD tags) reveals previously unresolved genetic structure and direction of evolution in the pitcher plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, from a southern Appalachian Mountain refugium following recession of the Laurentide Ice Sheet at 22,000-19,000 B.P. The RAD tag method can be used to identify detailed patterns of phylogeography in any organism regardless of existing genomic data, and, more broadly, to identify incipient speciation and genome-wide variation in natural populations in general.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a bewildering diversity of signals, sensory systems, and signaling behavior. A consideration of how these traits affect each other's evolution explains some of this diversity. Natural selection favors signals, receptors, and signaling behavior that maximize the received signals relative to background noise and minimize signal degradation. Properties of sensory systems bias the direction of evolution of the signals that they receive. For example, females may prefer males whose signals they can perceive more easily, and this will lead to the spread of more easily perceived male traits. Environmental conditions during signal transmission and detection also affect signal perception. Specific environmental conditions will bias the evolutionary direction of behavior, which affects the time and place of signaling as well as microhabitat preferences. Increased specialization of microhabitats and signaling behavior may lead to biased evolution of the sensory systems to work more efficiently. Thus, sensory systems, signals, signaling behavior, and habitat choice are evolutionarily coupled. These suites of traits should coevolve in predictable directions, determined by environmental biophysics, neurobiology, and the genetics of the suites of traits--hence the term "sensory drive." Because conditions vary in space and time, diversity will be generated},

Protein family classification can significantly contribute to the delineation of functional diversity of homologous proteins, the prediction of function based on domain architecture or the presence of sequence motifs as well as comparative genomics, providing valuable evolutionary insights. We present a novel approach called TRIBE-MCL for rapid and accurate clustering of protein sequences into families. The method relies on the Markov cluster (MCL) algorithm for the assignment of proteins into families based on precomputed sequence similarity information. This novel approach does not suffer from the problems that normally hinder other protein sequence clustering algorithms, such as the presence of multi-domain proteins, promiscuous domains and fragmented proteins. The method has been rigorously tested and validated on a number of very large databases, including SwissProt, InterPro, SCOP and the draft human genome. Our results indicate that the method is ideally suited to the rapid and accurate detection of protein families on a large scale. The method has been used to detect and categorise protein families within the draft human genome and the resulting families have been used to annotate a large proportion of human proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {Metabarcoding approaches use total and typically degraded DNA from environmental samples to analyse biotic assemblages and can potentially be carried out for any kinds of organisms in an ecosystem. These analyses rely on specific markers, here called metabarcodes, which should be optimized for taxonomic resolution, minimal bias in amplification of the target organism group and short sequence length. Using bioinformatic tools, we developed metabarcodes for several groups of organisms: fungi, bryophytes, enchytraeids, beetles and birds. The ability of these metabarcodes to amplify the target groups was systematically evaluated by (i) in silico PCRs using all standard sequences in the EMBL public database as templates, (ii) in vitro PCRs of DNA extracts from surface soil samples from a site in Varanger, northern Norway and (iii) in vitro PCRs of DNA extracts from permanently frozen sediment samples of late-Pleistocene age (‚àº16¬†000‚Äì50¬†000¬†years bp) from two Siberian sites, Duvanny Yar and Main River. Comparison of the results from the in silico PCR with those obtained in vitro showed that the in silico approach offered a reliable estimate of the suitability of a marker. All target groups were detected in the environmental DNA, but we found large variation in the level of detection among the groups and between modern and ancient samples. Success rates for the Pleistocene samples were highest for fungal DNA, whereas bryophyte, beetle and bird sequences could also be retrieved, but to a much lesser degree. The metabarcoding approach has considerable potential for biodiversity screening of modern samples and also as a palaeoecological tool.},

  Abstract                 = {Landscape genetics seeks to determine the effect of landscape features on gene flow and genetic structure. Often, such analyses are intended to inform conservation and management. However, depending on the many factors that influence the time to reach equilibrium, genetic structure may more strongly represent past rather than contemporary landscapes. This well-known lag between current demographic processes and population genetic structure often makes it challenging to interpret how contemporary landscapes and anthropogenic activity shape gene flow. Here, we review the theoretical framework for factors that influence time lags, summarize approaches to address this temporal disconnect in landscape genetic studies, and evaluate ways to make inferences about landscape change and its effects on species using genetic data alone or in combination with other data. Those approaches include comparing correlation of genetic structure with historical versus contemporary landscapes, using molecular markers with different rates of evolution, contrasting metrics of genetic structure and gene flow that reflect population genetic processes operating at different temporal scales, comparing historical and contemporary samples, combining genetic data with contemporary estimates of species distribution or movement, and controlling for phylogeographic history. We recommend using simulated data sets to explore time lags in genetic structure, and argue that time lags should be explicitly considered both when designing and interpreting landscape genetic studies. We conclude that the time lag problem can be exploited to strengthen inferences about recent landscape changes and to establish conservation baselines, particularly when genetic data are combined with other data.},

  Abstract                 = {The past decade has seen a proliferation of studies that employ quantitative trait locus (QTL) approaches to diagnose the genetic basis of trait evolution. Advances in molecular techniques and analytical methods have suggested that an exact genetic description of the number and distribution of genes affecting a trait can be obtained. Although this possibility has met with some success in model systems such as Drosophila and Arabidopsis, the pursuit of an exact description of QTL effects, i.e. individual gene effect, in most cases has proven problematic. We discuss why QTL methods will have difficulty in identifying individual genes contributing to trait variation, and distinguish between the identification of QTL (or marker intervals) and the identification of individual genes or nucleotide differences within genes (QTN). This review focuses on what ecologists and evolutionary biologists working with natural populations can realistically expect to learn from QTL studies. We highlight representative issues in ecology and evolutionary biology and discuss the range of questions that can be addressed satisfactorily using QTL approaches. We specifically address developing approaches to QTL analysis in outbred populations, and discuss practical considerations of experimental (cross) design and application of different marker types. Throughout this review we attempt to provide a balanced description of the benefits of QTL methodology to studies in ecology and evolution as well as the inherent assumptions and limitations that may constrain its application.},

The loss of these animals may be humankind's most pervasive influence on nature. Although such losses are widely viewed as an ethical and aesthetic problem, recent research reveals extensive cascading effects of their disappearance in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems worldwide. This empirical work supports long-standing theory about the role of top-down forcing in ecosystems but also highlights the unanticipated impacts of trophic cascades on processes as diverse as the dynamics of disease, wildfire, carbon sequestration, invasive species, and biogeochemical cycles. These findings emphasize the urgent need for interdisciplinary research to forecast the effects of trophic downgrading on process, function, and resilience in global ecosystems.},

  Abstract                 = {Inferring the spatial expansion dynamics of invading species from molecular data is notoriously difficult due to the complexity of the processes involved. For these demographic scenarios, genetic data obtained from highly variable markers may be profitably combined with specific sampling schemes and information from other sources using a Bayesian approach. The geographic range of the introduced toad Bufo marinus is still expanding in eastern and northern Australia, in each case from isolates established around 1960. A large amount of demographic and historical information is available on both expansion areas. In each area, samples were collected along a transect representing populations of different ages and genotyped at 10 microsatellite loci. Five demographic models of expansion, differing in the dispersal pattern for migrants and founders and in the number of founders, were considered. Because the demographic history is complex, we used an approximate Bayesian method, based on a rejection-regression algorithm, to formally test the relative likelihoods of the five models of expansion and to infer demographic parameters. A stepwise migration-foundation model with founder events was statistically better supported than other four models in both expansion areas. Posterior distributions supported different dynamics of expansion in the studied areas. Populations in the eastern expansion area have a lower stable effective population size and have been founded by a smaller number of individuals than those in the northern expansion area. Once demographically stabilized, populations exchange a substantial number of effective migrants per generation in both expansion areas, and such exchanges are larger in northern than in eastern Australia. The effective number of migrants appears to be considerably lower than that of founders in both expansion areas. We found our inferences to be relatively robust to various assumptions on marker, demographic, and historical features. The method presented here is the only robust, model-based method available so far, which allows inferring complex population dynamics over a short time scale. It also provides the basis for investigating the interplay between population dynamics, drift, and selection in invasive species.},

  Abstract                 = {Homoplasy has recently attracted the attention of population geneticists, as a consequence of the popularity of highly variable stepwise mutating markers such as microsatellites. Microsatellite alleles generally refer to DNA fragments of different size (electromorphs). Electromorphs are identical in state (i.e. have identical size), but are not necessarily identical by descent due to convergent mutation(s). Homoplasy occurring at microsatellites is thus referred to as size homoplasy. Using new analytical developments and computer simulations, we first evaluate the effect of the mutation rate, the mutation model, the effective population size and the time of divergence between populations on size homoplasy at the within and between population levels. We then review the few experimental studies that used various molecular techniques to detect size homoplasious events at some microsatellite loci. The relationship between this molecularly accessible size homoplasy size and the actual amount of size homoplasy is not trivial, the former being considerably influenced by the molecular structure of microsatellite core sequences. In a third section, we show that homoplasy at microsatellite electromorphs does not represent a significant problem for many types of population genetics analyses realized by molecular ecologists, the large amount of variability at microsatellite loci often compensating for their homoplasious evolution. The situations where size homoplasy may be more problematic involve high mutation rates and large population sizes together with strong allele size constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {Comparison of demo-genetic models using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is an active research field. Although large numbers of populations and models (i.e. scenarios) can be analysed with ABC using molecular data obtained from various marker types, methodological and computational issues arise when these numbers become too large. Moreover, Robert et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 2011, 108, 15112) have shown that the conclusions drawn on ABC model comparison cannot be trusted per se and required additional simulation analyses. Monte Carlo inferential techniques to empirically evaluate confidence in scenario choice are very time-consuming, however, when the numbers of summary statistics (Ss) and scenarios are large. We here describe a methodological innovation to process efficient ABC scenario probability computation using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on Ss before computing logistic regression. We used simulated pseudo-observed data sets (pods) to assess the main features of the method (precision and computation time) in comparison with traditional probability estimation using raw (i.e. not LDA transformed) Ss. We also illustrate the method on real microsatellite data sets produced to make inferences about the invasion routes of the coccinelid Harmonia axyridis. We found that scenario probabilities computed from LDA-transformed and raw Ss were strongly correlated. Type I and II errors were similar for both methods. The faster probability computation that we observed (speed gain around a factor of 100 for LDA-transformed Ss) substantially increases the ability of ABC practitioners to analyse large numbers of pods and hence provides a manageable way to empirically evaluate the power available to discriminate among a large set of complex scenarios.},

Research in population genetics, quantitative trait mapping, comparative genomics, and phylogeography that was unthinkable even a few years ago is now possible. More importantly, these next-generation sequencing studies can be performed in organisms for which few genomic resources presently exist. To speed this revolution in evolutionary genetics, we have developed Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD) genotyping, a method that uses Illumina next-generation sequencing to simultaneously discover and score tens to hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in hundreds of individuals for minimal investment of resources. In this chapter, we describe the core RAD-seq protocol, which can be modified to suit a diversity of evolutionary genetic questions. In addition, we discuss bioinformatic considerations that arise from unique aspects of next-generation sequencing data as compared to traditional marker-based approaches, and we outline some general analytical approaches for RAD-seq and similar data. Despite considerable progress, the development of analytical tools remains in its infancy, and further work is needed to fully quantify sampling variance and biases in these data types.},

We use this RAD-PE contig approach to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and determine haplotype structure in threespine stickleback and to sequence E. coli and stickleback genomic DNA with overlapping contigs of several hundred nucleotides. We also demonstrate that adding a circularization step allows the local assembly of contigs up to 5 kilobases (kb) in length. The ease of assembly and accuracy of the individual contigs produced from each RAD site sequence suggests RAD-PE sequencing is a useful way to convert genome-wide short reads into individually-assembled sequences hundreds or thousands of nucleotides long.},

  Abstract                 = {In species with separate sexes, social systems can differ in the relative variances of male versus female reproductive success. Papionin monkeys (macaques, mangabeys, mandrills, drills, baboons, and geladas) exhibit hallmarks of a high variance in male reproductive success, including a female-biased adult sex ratio and prominent sexual dimorphism. To explore the potential genomic consequences of such sex differences, we used a reduced representation genome sequencing approach to quantifying polymorphism at sites on autosomes and sex chromosomes of the tonkean macaque (Macaca tonkeana), a species endemic to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The ratio of nucleotide diversity of the X chromosome to that of the autosomes was less than the value (0.75) expected with a 1:1 sex ratio and no sex differences in the variance in reproductive success. However, the significance of this difference was dependent on which outgroup was used to standardize diversity levels. Using a new model that includes the effects of varying population size, sex differences in mutation rate between the autosomes and X chromosome, and GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) or selection on GC content, we found that the maximum-likelihood estimate of the ratio of effective population size of the X chromosome to that of the autosomes was 0.68, which did not differ significantly from 0.75. We also found evidence for 1) a higher level of purifying selection on genic than nongenic regions, 2) gBGC or natural selection favoring increased GC content, 3) a dynamic demography characterized by population growth and contraction, 4) a higher mutation rate in males than females, and 5) a very low polymorphism level on the Y chromosome. These findings shed light on the population genomic consequences of sex differences in the variance in reproductive success, which appear to be modest in the tonkean macaque; they also suggest the occurrence of hitchhiking on the Y chromosome.},

  Abstract                 = {Meiotic maps are a key tool for comparative genomics and association mapping studies. Next-generation sequencing and genotyping by sequencing are speeding the processes of SNP discovery and the development of new genetic tools, including meiotic maps for numerous species. Currently there are limited genetic resources for sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka. We develop the first dense meiotic map for sockeye salmon using a combination of novel SNPs found in restriction site associated DNA (RAD tags) and SNPs available from existing expressed sequence tag (EST) based assays.We discovered and genotyped putative SNPs in 3,430 RAD tags. We removed paralogous sequence variants leaving 1,672 SNPs; these were combined with 53 EST-based SNP genotypes for linkage mapping. The map contained 29 male and female linkage groups, consistent with the haploid chromosome number expected for sockeye salmon. The female map contains 1,057 loci spanning 4,896 cM, and the male map contains 1,118 loci spanning 4,220 cM. Regions of conservation with rainbow trout and synteny between the RAD based rainbow trout map and the sockeye salmon map were established.Using RAD sequencing and EST-based SNP assays we successfully generated the first high density linkage map for sockeye salmon.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a flexible and robust simulation-based framework to infer demographic parameters from the site frequency spectrum (SFS) computed on large genomic datasets. We show that our composite-likelihood approach allows one to study evolutionary models of arbitrary complexity, which cannot be tackled by other current likelihood-based methods. For simple scenarios, our approach compares favorably in terms of accuracy and speed with ∂a∂i, the current reference in the field, while showing better convergence properties for complex models. We first apply our methodology to non-coding genomic SNP data from four human populations. To infer their demographic history, we compare neutral evolutionary models of increasing complexity, including unsampled populations. We further show the versatility of our framework by extending it to the inference of demographic parameters from SNP chips with known ascertainment, such as that recently released by Affymetrix to study human origins. Whereas previous ways of handling ascertained SNPs were either restricted to a single population or only allowed the inference of divergence time between a pair of populations, our framework can correctly infer parameters of more complex models including the divergence of several populations, bottlenecks and migration. We apply this approach to the reconstruction of African demography using two distinct ascertained human SNP panels studied under two evolutionary models. The two SNP panels lead to globally very similar estimates and confidence intervals, and suggest an ancient divergence (>110 Ky) between Yoruba and San populations. Our methodology appears well suited to the study of complex scenarios from large genomic data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {Patterns of genetic diversity between populations are often used to detect loci under selection in genome scans. Indeed, loci involved in local adaptations should show high F(ST) values, whereas loci under balancing selection should rather show low F(ST) values. Most tests of selection based on F(ST) use a null distribution generated under a simple island model of population differentiation. Although this model has been shown to be robust, many species have a more complex genetic structure, with some populations sharing a recent ancestry or due to the presence of barriers to gene flow between different parts of a species range. In this paper, we propose the use of a hierarchical island model, in which demes exchange more migrants within groups than between groups, to generate the joint distribution of genetic diversity within and between populations. We show that tests not accounting for a hierarchical structure, when it exists, do generate a large excess of false positive loci, whereas the hierarchical island model is robust to uncertainties about the exact number of groups and demes per group in the system. Our approach also explicitly takes into account the mutational process, and does not just rely on allele frequencies, which is important for short tandem repeat (STR) data. An application to human and stickleback STR data sets reveals a much lower number of significant loci than previously obtained under a non-hierarchical model. The elimination of false positive loci from genome scans should allow us to better determine on which specific class of genes selection is operating.},

  Abstract                 = {We present here a framework for the study of molecular variation within a single species. Information on DNA haplotype divergence is incorporated into an analysis of variance format, derived from a matrix of squared-distances among all pairs of haplotypes. This analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) produces estimates of variance components and F-statistic analogs, designated here as phi-statistics, reflecting the correlation of haplotypic diversity at different levels of hierarchical subdivision. The method is flexible enough to accommodate several alternative input matrices, corresponding to different types of molecular data, as well as different types of evolutionary assumptions, without modifying the basic structure of the analysis. The significance of the variance components and phi-statistics is tested using a permutational approach, eliminating the normality assumption that is conventional for analysis of variance but inappropriate for molecular data. Application of AMOVA to human mitochondrial DNA haplotype data shows that population subdivisions are better resolved when some measure of molecular differences among haplotypes is introduced into the analysis. At the intraspecific level, however, the additional information provided by knowing the exact phylogenetic relations among haplotypes or by a nonlinear translation of restriction-site change into nucleotide diversity does not significantly modify the inferred population genetic structure. Monte Carlo studies show that site sampling does not fundamentally affect the significance of the molecular variance components. The AMOVA treatment is easily extended in several different directions and it constitutes a coherent and flexible framework for the statistical analysis of molecular data.},

  Abstract                 = {DNA methylation is a widely conserved epigenetic modification. The analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation patterns in various organisms suggests that major features of animal methylomes are widely conserved. However, based on the variation of DNA methyltransferase genes in invertebrates, it has also been proposed that DNA methylation could provide a molecular mechanism for ecological adaptation. We have now analyzed the methylome of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, which represents an organism with a high degree of phenotypic plasticity. Using genome-scale bisulfite sequencing, we show here that the S. gregaria methylome is characterized by CpG- and exon-specific methylation and thus shares two major features with other animal methylomes. In contrast to other invertebrates, however, overall methylation levels were substantially higher and a significant fraction of transposons was methylated. Additionally, genic sequences were densely methylated in a pronounced bimodal pattern, suggesting a role for DNA methylation in the regulation of locust gene expression. Our results thus uncover a unique pattern of genome methylation in locusts and provide an important foundation for investigating the role of DNA methylation in locust phase polyphenism.},

Histories can also be reconstructed using the same procedure for groups which do not have admixture in their recent history, where recent genetic drift is strong or that deviate in other ways from the underlying inference model. Unfortunately, such histories can be misleading. We have implemented an approach (available at www.paintmychromsomes.com) to assessing the goodness of fit of the model using the ancestry {\textquoteright}palettes{\textquoteright} estimated by CHROMOPAINTER and apply it to both simulated and real examples. Combining these complementary analyses with additional methods that are designed to test specific hypothesis allows a richer and more robust analysis of recent demographic history based on genetic data.},

Similarly, the presence of null alleles and the limitations of genotype calling in polyploids mean that many conventional analysis methods are invalid for many organisms. Here we present a simple approach for accounting for genotypic ambiguity in studies of population structure and apply it to AFLP data from whitefish.

  Abstract                 = {We describe extensions to the method of Pritchard et al. for inferring population structure from multilocus genotype data. Most importantly, we develop methods that allow for linkage between loci. The new model accounts for the correlations between linked loci that arise in admixed populations ("admixture linkage disequilibium"). This modification has several advantages, allowing (1) detection of admixture events farther back into the past, (2) inference of the population of origin of chromosomal regions, and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of potential use for admixture mapping. In addition, we describe a new prior model for the allele frequencies within each population, which allows identification of subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable using the existing method. We present results applying the new methods to study admixture in African-Americans, recombination in Helicobacter pylori, and drift in populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The methods are implemented in a program, structure, version 2.0, which is available at http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu.},

The audiograms and spectrograms revealed that active mobile phone handsets have a dramatic impact on the behavior of the bees, namely by inducing the worker piping signal.

If recombination is present but rare, both deterministic and stochastic models of positive selection show that linked variation hitchhikes to either low or high frequencies. While the frequency distribution of variation can be influenced by a number of evolutionary processes, an excess of derived variants at high frequency is a unique pattern produced by hitchhiking (derived refers to the nonancestral state as determined from an outgroup). We adopt a statistic, H, to measure an excess of high compared to intermediate frequency variants. Only a few high-frequency variants are needed to detect hitchhiking since not many are expected under neutrality. This is of particular utility in regions of low recombination where there is not much variation and in regions of normal or high recombination, where the hitchhiking effect can be limited to a small (<1 kb) region. Application of the H test to published surveys of Drosophila variation reveals an excess of high frequency variants that are likely to have been influenced by positive selection.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary.‚ÄÇ Many modern statistical applications involve inference for complex stochastic models, where it is easy to simulate from the models, but impossible to calculate likelihoods. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a method of inference for such models. It replaces calculation of the likelihood by a step which involves simulating artificial data for different parameter values, and comparing summary statistics of the simulated data with summary statistics of the observed data. Here we show how to construct appropriate summary statistics for ABC in a semi-automatic manner. We aim for summary statistics which will enable inference about certain parameters of interest to be as accurate as possible. Theoretical results show that optimal summary statistics are the posterior means of the parameters. Although these cannot be calculated analytically, we use an extra stage of simulation to estimate how the posterior means vary as a function of the data; and we then use these estimates of our summary statistics within ABC. Empirical results show that our approach is a robust method for choosing summary statistics that can result in substantially more accurate ABC analyses than the ad hoc choices of summary statistics that have been proposed in the literature. We also demonstrate advantages over two alternative methods of simulation-based inference.},

We describe here a theory predicting four phases of speciation, defined by changes in the relative effectiveness of divergence and genome hitchhiking, and review empirical data in light of the theory. We outline future directions, emphasizing the need to couple next-generation sequencing with selection, transplant, functional genomics, and mapping studies. This will permit a natural history of speciation genomics that will help to elucidate the factors responsible for population divergence and the roles that genome structure and different forms of hitchhiking play in facilitating the genesis of new biodiversity.},

  Abstract                 = {Theoretical models addressing genome-wide patterns of divergence during speciation are needed to help us understand the evolutionary processes generating empirical patterns. Here, we examine a critical issue concerning speciation-with-gene flow: to what degree does physical linkage (r < 0.5) of new mutations to already diverged genes aid the build-up of genomic islands of differentiation? We used simulation and analytical approaches to partition the probability of establishment for a new divergently selected mutation when the mutation (i) is the first to arise in an undifferentiated genome (the direct effect of selection), (ii) arises unlinked to any selected loci (r = 0.5), but within a genome that has some already diverged genes (the effect of genome-wide reductions in gene flow for facilitating divergence, which we term 'genome hitchhiking'), and (iii) arises in physical linkage to a diverged locus (divergence hitchhiking). We find that the strength of selection acting directly on a new mutation is generally the most important predictor for establishment, with divergence and genomic hitchhiking having smaller effects. We outline the specific conditions under which divergence and genome hitchhiking can aid mutation establishment. The results generate predictions about genome divergence at different points in the speciation process and avenues for further work.},

This observation has led to verbal "divergence hitchhiking" models of speciation in which decreased interpopulation gene flow surrounding loci under divergent selection can generate large regions of differentiation within the genome (genomic islands). The efficacy of this model in promoting speciation depends on the size of the region affected by divergence hitchhiking. Empirical evidence is mixed, with examples of both large and small genomic islands. To address these empirical discrepancies and to formalize the theory, we present mathematical models of divergence hitchhiking, which examine neutral differentiation around selected sites. For a single locus under selection, regions of differentiation do not extend far along a chromosome away from a selected site unless both effective population sizes and migration rates are low. When multiple loci are considered, regions of differentiation can be larger. However, with many loci under selection, genome-wide divergence occurs and genomic islands are erased. The results show that divergence hitchhiking can generate large regions of differentiation, but that the conditions under which this occurs are limited. Thus, speciation may often require multifarious selection acting on many, isolated and physically unlinked genes. How hitchhiking promotes further adaptive divergence warrants consideration.},

  Abstract                 = {Many factors can promote speciation, and one which has received much attention is chromosomal inversions. A number of models propose that the recombination suppressing effects of inversions facilitate the maintenance of differences between interbreeding populations in genes affecting adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation. These models predict that such genes will disproportionately reside within inversions, rather than in collinear regions. This hypothesis has received some support, but exceptions exist. Additionally, the effects of known low levels of recombination within inversions on these models are uninvestigated. Here, simulations are used to compare the maintenance of genetic differences between populations following secondary contact and hybridization in different inversion models. We compare regions with no recombination within them to regions with low recombination and to collinear regions with free recombination. Our most general finding is that the low levels of recombination within an inversion often result in the loss of accentuated divergence in inverted regions compared to collinear ones. We conclude that inversions can facilitate the maintenance of species differences under some conditions, but that large or qualitative differences between inverted and collinear regions need not occur. We also find that strong selection facilitates maintenance of divergence in a manner analogous to inversions.},

The derivatization process, first developed for glass slides, was then adapted to microfabricated glass channels containing integrated fluidic connections. This implementation resulted in an important reduction of reaction times, consumption of reagents and process automation. Innovative analytical methods for the characterization of attached DNA were developed for assessing the surface immobilized DNA content after amplification. The results obtained showed that the BTA chemistry is compatible and suitable for forming highly dense arrays of DNA colonies with optimal surface coverage of about 10 million colonies/cm(2) from the amplification of initial single-template DNA molecules immobilized. We also demonstrate that the dsDNA colonies generated can be quantitatively processed in situ by restriction enzymes digestion. DNA colonies generated using the BTA reagent can be used for further sequence analysis in an unprecedented parallel fashion for low-cost genomic studies.},

  Abstract                 = {A computer simulation study has been made of the accuracy of estimates of Theta = 4Nemu from a sample from a single isolated population of finite size. The accuracies turn out to be well predicted by a formula developed by Fu and Li, who used optimistic assumptions. Their formulas are restated in terms of accuracy, defined here as the reciprocal of the squared coefficient of variation. This should be proportional to sample size when the entities sampled provide independent information. Using these formulas for accuracy, the sampling strategy for estimation of Theta can be investigated. Two models for cost have been used, a cost-per-base model and a cost-per-read model. The former would lead us to prefer to have a very large number of loci, each one base long. The latter, which is more realistic, causes us to prefer to have one read per locus and an optimum sample size which declines as costs of sampling organisms increase. For realistic values, the optimum sample size is 8 or fewer individuals. This is quite close to the results obtained by Pluzhnikov and Donnelly for a cost-per-base model, evaluating other estimators of Theta. It can be understood by considering that the resources spent collecting larger samples prevent us from considering more loci. An examination of the efficiency of Watterson's estimator of Theta was also made, and it was found to be reasonably efficient when the number of mutants per generation in the sequence in the whole population is less than 2.5.},

Furthermore, samples of low quality or problems in the experimental protocol often cause a loss of data even with traditional sequencing technologies. Here we propose modified estimators of variability and neutrality tests that can be naturally applied to sequences with missing data, without the need to remove bases or individuals from the analysis. Modified statistics include the Watterson estimator Œ∏W, Tajima{\textquoteright}s D, Fay and Wu{\textquoteright}s H, and HKA. We develop a general framework to take missing data into account in frequency spectrum-based neutrality tests and we derive the exact expression for the variance of these statistics under the neutral model. The neutrality tests proposed here can also be used as summary statistics to describe the information contained in other classes of data like DNA microarrays.},

Analysing methylation in insects has indicated an apparent functional diversity that seems to argue against a strict functional conservation. To investigate this hypothesis, we here assess the data reported in four different insect species in which DNA methylation has been analysed more thoroughly: the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the cabbage moth Mamestra brassicae, the peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae and the mealybug Planococcus citri.},

We examined how the direction and magnitude of epistatic interactions in a polygenic trait under stabilizing selection influenced the evolution of hybrid incompatibilities. We found that populations evolving independently under stabilizing selection experienced suites of compensatory allelic changes that resulted in genetic divergence between populations despite the maintenance of a stable, high-fitness phenotype. A small number of loci were then incompatible with multiple alleles in the genetic background of the hybrid and the identity of these incompatibility loci changed over the evolution of the populations. For F1 hybrids, reduced fitness evolved in a window of intermediate strengths of epistatic interactions, but F2 and backcross hybrids evolved reduced fitness across weak and moderate strengths of epistasis due to segregation variance. Strong epistatic interactions constrained the allelic divergence of parental populations and prevented the development of reproductive isolation. Because many traits with varying genetic architectures must be under stabilizing selection, our results indicate that polygenetic drift is a plausible hypothesis for the evolution of postzygotic reproductive isolation.},

In the present study, using the concept of EFMs (elementary flux modes), we established all of the potential routes in a network describing NAD(+) biosynthesis and degradation. All known biosynthetic pathways, which include de novo synthesis starting from tryptophan as well as the classical Preiss-Handler pathway and NAD(+) synthesis from other vitamin precursors, were detected as EFMs. Moreover, several EFMs were found that degrade NAD(+), represent futile cycles or have other functionalities. The systematic analysis and comparison of the networks specific for yeast and humans document significant differences between species with regard to the use of precursors, biosynthetic routes and NAD(+)-dependent signalling.},

  Abstract                 = {Hybrid zones typically form as a result of species coming into secondary contact, but can also be established in¬†situ as an ecotonal hybrid zone, a situation which has been reported far less frequently. An altitudinal hybrid zone on Mount Etna between two ragwort species (the low elevation Senecio chrysanthemifolius and high elevation S.¬†aethnensis) could potentially represent either of these possibilities. However, a scenario of secondary contact vs. speciation with gene flow has not been explicitly tested. Here, we test these alternatives and demonstrate that the data do not support secondary contact. Furthermore, we report that the previous analyses of speciation history of these species were based on admixed populations, which has led to inflated estimates of ongoing, interspecific gene flow. Our new analyses, based on ‚Äòpure‚Äô S.¬†aethnensis and S.¬†chrysanthemifolius populations, reveal gene exchange of less than one effective migrant per generation, a level low enough to allow the species to accumulate neutral, genomewide differences. Overall, our results are consistent with a scenario of speciation with gene flow and a divergence time which coincides with the rise of Mt. Etna to altitudes above 2000¬†m (~150¬†KY). Further work to quantify the role of adaptation to contrasting environments of high and low altitudes will be needed to support the scenario of recent ecological speciation in this system.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing technologies have fostered an unprecedented proliferation of high-throughput sequencing projects and a concomitant development of novel algorithms for the assembly of short reads. In this context, an important issue is the need of a careful assessment of the accuracy of the assembly process. Here, we review the efficiency of a panel of assemblers, specifically designed to handle data from GS FLX 454 platform, on three bacterial data sets with different characteristics in terms of reads coverage and repeats content. Our aim is to investigate their strengths and weaknesses in the reconstruction of the reference genomes. In our benchmarking, we assess assemblers' performance, quantifying and characterizing assembly gaps and errors, and evaluating their ability to solve complex genomic regions containing repeats. The final goal of this analysis is to highlight pros and cons of each method, in order to provide the final user with general criteria for the right choice of the appropriate assembly strategy, depending on the specific needs. A further aspect we have explored is the relationship between coverage of a sequencing project and quality of the obtained results. The final outcome suggests that, for a good tradeoff between costs and results, the planned genome coverage of an experiment should not exceed 20-30 ×.},

Here, we examine genomewide patterns of nucleotide variation in natural populations of the outcrossing herb Arabidopsis halleri and associations with climatic variation among populations in the Alps. Using a pooled population sequencing (Pool-Seq) approach, we discovered more than two million SNPs in five natural populations and identified highly differentiated genomic regions and SNPs using FST -based analyses. We tested only the most strongly differentiated SNPs for associations with a nonredundant set of environmental factors using partial Mantel tests to identify topo-climatic factors that may underlie the observed footprints of selection. Possible functions of genes showing signatures of selection were identified by Gene Ontology analysis. We found 175 genes to be highly associated with one or more of the five tested topo-climatic factors. Of these, 23.4\% had unknown functions. Genetic variation in four candidate genes was strongly associated with site water balance and solar radiation, and functional annotations were congruent with these environmental factors. Our results provide a genomewide perspective on the distribution of adaptive genetic variation in natural plant populations from a highly diverse and heterogeneous alpine environment.},

  Abstract                 = {The importance of geographic isolation in speciation has been debated since the 19th century. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the consensus has been that most speciation involves divergence in allopatry. This consensus was based largely on decades of observations by naturalists and verbal arguments against speciation without isolation. Recent attempts to quantify the importance of allopatric versus sympatric speciation using comparative methods called "age-range correlation" (ARC) suggest that allopatric speciation is more common than sympatric speciation. However, very few taxa have been studied and there are concerns about the adequacy of the methods. We propose methodological improvements including changes in the way overlap between clades is quantified and Monte Carlo methods to test the null hypothesis of no relationship between phylogenetic relatedness and geographic range overlap. We analyze 14 clades of mammals, chosen because of the availability of data and the consensus among mammalogists that speciation is routinely allopatric. Although data from a few clades clearly indicate allopatric speciation, divergence with gene flow is plausible in others and many results are inconclusive. The relative rarity of significant correlations between phylogenetic distance and range overlap may have three distinct causes: (1) post-speciation range changes, (2) relative rarity of range overlap, and (3) a mixture of geographic modes of speciation. Our results support skepticism about ARC's power for inferring the biogeography of speciation. Yet, even if few clades provide clear signals, meta-analytic approaches such as ARC may set bounds on the prevalence of alternative modes of speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {Sexual selection drives the evolution of traits involved in the competition for mates. Although considerable research has focused on the evolution of sexually selected traits, their underlying genetic architecture is poorly resolved. Here I address the pleiotropic effects and genomic locations of sexually selected genes. These two important characteristics can impose considerable constraints on evolvability and may influence our understanding of the process of sexual selection. Theoretical models are inconsistent regarding the genomic location of sexually selected genes. Models that do not incorporate pleiotropic effects often predict sex linkage. Conversely, sex linkage is not explicitly predicted by the condition-dependent model (which considers pleiotropic effects). Evidence largely based on reciprocal crosses supports the notion of sex linkage. However, although they infer genetic contribution, reciprocal crosses cannot identify the genes or their pleiotropic effects. By surveying the genome of Drosophila melanogaster, I provide evidence for the genomic location and pleiotropic effects of 63 putatively sexually selected genes. Interestingly, most are pleiotropic (73\%), and they are not preferentially sex linked. Their pleiotropic effects include fertility, development, life span, and viability, which may contribute to condition and/or fitness. My findings may also provide evidence for the capture of genetic variation in condition via the pleiotropic effects of sexually selected genes.},

Our aim was to investigate the potential refuge locations using species distribution modelling to estimate the geographical distribution of suitable climatic conditions for selected rodent species during the LGM.Location‚ÄÇ Eurasia.Methods‚ÄÇ Presence/absence data for seven rodent species with range limits corresponding to the limits of temperate or boreal forest or arctic tundra were used in the analysis. We developed predictive distribution models based on the species present-day European distributions and validated these against their present-day Siberian ranges. The models with the best predictors of the species distributions across Siberia were projected onto LGM climate simulations to assess the distribution of climatically suitable areas.Results‚ÄÇ The best distribution models provided good predictions of the present-day Siberian ranges of the study species. Their LGM projections showed that areas with a suitable LGM climate for the three temperate species (Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus sylvaticus and Microtus arvalis) were largely restricted to the traditionally recognized southern refuge areas, i.e. mainly in the Mediterranean region, but also southernmost France and southern parts of the Russian Plain. In contrast, suitable climatic conditions for the two boreal species (Clethrionomys glareous and Microtus agrestis) were predicted as far north as southern England and across southern parts of central and eastern Europe eastwards into the Russian Plain. For the two arctic species (Lemmus lemmus and Microtus oeconomus), suitable climate was predicted from the Atlantic coast eastward across central Europe and into Russia.Main conclusions‚ÄÇ Our results support the idea of more northerly refuge areas in Europe, indicating that boreal species would have found suitable living conditions over much of southern central and eastern Europe and the Russian Plain. Temperate species would have primarily found suitable conditions in the traditional southern refuge areas, but interestingly also in much of the southern Russian Plain.},

  Abstract                 = {P>Here, we describe the evolution of gene expression among a diversified cohort of five allopolyploid species in the cotton genus (Gossypium). Using this phylogenetic framework and comparisons with expression changes accompanying F-1 hybridization, we provide a temporal perspective on expression diversification following a shared genome duplication. Global patterns of gene expression were studied by the hybridization of petal RNAs to a custom microarray. This platform measures total expression for c. 42 000 duplicated genes, and genome-specific expression for c. 1400 homoeologs (genes duplicated by polyploidy). We report homoeolog expression bias favoring the allopolyploid D genome over the A genome in all species (among five polyploid species, D biases ranging from c. 54 to 60%), in addition to conservation of biases among genes. Furthermore, we find surprising levels of transgressive up- and down-regulation in the allopolyploids, a diminution of the level of bias in genomic expression dominance but not in its magnitude, and high levels of rate variation among allotetraploid species. We illustrate how phylogenetic and temporal components of expression evolution may be partitioned and revealed following allopolyploidy. Overall patterns of expression evolution are similar among the Gossypium allotetraploids, notwithstanding a high level of interspecific rate variation, but differ strikingly from the direction of genomic expression dominance patterns in the synthetic F-1 hybrid. },

  Abstract                 = {This thesis examines the evolutionary divergence between northern European and Italian populations of Chorthippus parallelus. Several differing approaches were taken, which identified the inception of various components of the speciation process between these parapatric populations which meet in the Alps. Firstly, partial post-zygotic reproductive isolation was demonstrated using hybrid crosses. The male hybrid offspring of both reciprocal crosses were sterile, displaying severe testicular dysfunction, while the female hybrids showed no deleterious effects of hybridisation. In this grasshopper the males are the heterogametic sex, possessing a single X chromosome, and so this pattern of hybrid sterility conforms to Haldane's rule. Secondly, investigation of the calling song of the male grasshopper, a component of the mate recognition system, suggested the presence of pre-mating reproductive isolation. Males from the different races were found to sing calling song of a significantly different structure. Finally, examination of DNA sequence divergence in a mitochondrial DNA marker demonstrated Significant levels of genetic differentiation between the races. This population divergence and incipient reproductive isolation parallels that found between the north European and Iberian populations of this grasshopper, and provides further evidence that the divergent geographical races have resulted from allopatric divergence while in isolated refugial populations during the glacial periods of the Pleistocene Epoch. These approaches were repeated to investigate genetic divergence between localised populations within the Italian peninsula. No hybrid dysfunction was observed between these populations, suggesting that they are recently derived from one continuous population. This was probably the refugial population of the last ice-age. Additionally, investigation with the mtDNA marker gave preliminary evidence for population expansion from the south to the north of Italy. Interestingly, the male calling song was Significantly different in populations from the north and the south of Italy, suggesting that a component of pre-mating reproductive isolation may have evolved prior to post-mating isolation in allopatric populations of C. parallelus.},

  Abstract                 = {Phylogeographical studies are typically based on haplotype data, occasionally on nuclear markers such as microsatellites, but rarely combine both. This is unfortunate because the use of markers with contrasting modes of inheritance and rates of evolution might provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of a species' history. Here we present a detailed study of the phylogeography of the greater horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, using 1098 bp of the mitochondrial ND2 gene from 45 localities from across its Palaearctic range to infer population history. In addition, we re-analysed a large microsatellite data set available for this species and compared the results of both markers to infer population relationships and the historical processes influencing them. We show that mtDNA, the most popular marker in phylogeography studies, yielded a misleading result, and would have led us to conclude erroneously that a single expansion had taken place in Europe. Only by combining the mitochondrial and microsatellite data sets are we able to reconstruct the species' history and show two colonization events in Europe, one before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and one after it. Combining markers also revealed the importance of Asia Minor as an ancient refugium for this species and a source population for the expansion of the greater horseshoe bat into Europe before the LGM.},

  Abstract                 = {Strong barriers to genetic exchange can exist at divergently selected loci, whereas alleles at neutral loci flow more readily between populations, thus impeding divergence and speciation in the face of gene flow. However, 'divergence hitchhiking' theory posits that divergent selection can generate large regions of differentiation around selected loci. 'Genome hitchhiking' theory suggests that selection can also cause reductions in average genome-wide rates of gene flow, resulting in widespread genomic divergence (rather than divergence only around specific selected loci). Spatial heterogeneity is ubiquitous in nature, yet previous models of genetic barriers to gene flow have explored limited combinations of spatial and selective scenarios. Using simulations of secondary contact of populations, we explore barriers to gene flow in various selective and spatial contexts in continuous, two-dimensional, spatially explicit environments. In general, the effects of hitchhiking are strongest in environments with regular spatial patterning of starkly divergent habitat types. When divergent selection is very strong, the absence of intermediate habitat types increases the effects of hitchhiking. However, when selection is moderate or weak, regular (vs. random) spatial arrangement of habitat types becomes more important than the presence of intermediate habitats per se. We also document counterintuitive processes arising from the stochastic interplay between selection, gene flow and drift. Our results indicate that generalization of results from two-deme models requires caution and increase understanding of the genomic and geographic basis of population divergence.},

Characterizing this variation and identifying its determinants are essential steps in our understanding of the human recombination process and its evolution.Using three large sets of European-American pedigrees, we examined variation in five recombination phenotypes that capture distinct aspects of crossing-over patterns. We found that the mean recombination rate in males and females and the historical hotspot usage are significantly heritable and are uncorrelated with one another. We then conducted a genome-wide association study in order to identify loci that influence them. We replicated associations of RNF212 with the mean rate in males and in females as well as the association of Inversion 17q21.31 with the female mean rate. We also replicated the association of PRDM9 with historical hotspot usage, finding that it explains most of the genetic variance in this phenotype. In addition, we identified a set of new candidate regions for further validation.These findings suggest that variation at broad and fine scales is largely separable and that, beyond three known loci, there is no evidence for common variation with large effects on recombination phenotypes.},

Here we analyse solutions to this dilemma, showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agricultural expansion, closing 'yield gaps' on underperforming lands, increasing cropping efficiency, shifting diets and reducing waste.

Several statistical methods have been proposed to study the genetic structure using AFLPs but they assume Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and do not estimate the inbreeding coefficient, F(IS). A Bayesian method has been proposed by Holsinger and colleagues that relaxes these simplifying assumptions but we have identified two sources of bias that can influence estimates based on these markers: (i) the use of a uniform prior on ancestral allele frequencies and (ii) the ascertainment bias of AFLP markers. We present a new Bayesian method that avoids these biases by using an implementation based on the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) algorithm. This new method estimates population-specific F(IS) and F(ST) values and offers users the possibility of taking into account the criteria for selecting the markers that are used in the analyses. The software is available at our web site (http://www-leca.ujf-grenoble.fr/logiciels.htm). Finally, we provide advice on how to avoid the effects of ascertainment bias.},

  Abstract                 = {Identifying loci under natural selection from genomic surveys is of great interest in different research areas. Commonly used methods to separate neutral effects from adaptive effects are based on locus-specific population differentiation coefficients to identify outliers. Here we extend such an approach to estimate directly the probability that each locus is subject to selection using a Bayesian method. We also extend it to allow the use of dominant markers like AFLPs. It has been shown that this model is robust to complex demographic scenarios for neutral genetic differentiation. Here we show that the inclusion of isolated populations that underwent a strong bottleneck can lead to a high rate of false positives. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to avoid them by carefully choosing the populations that should be included in the analysis. We analyze two previously published data sets: a human data set of codominant markers and a Littorina saxatilis data set of dominant markers. We also perform a detailed sensitivity study to compare the power of the method using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), SNP, and microsatellite markers.

Reconstruction of ancestral demographic history revealed bottlenecks during founder events, likely promoting ecological divergence and genetic drift resulting in a wide range of genome-wide differentiation between pairs of allopatric and sympatric ecotypes. Functional enrichment analyses provided evidence for regional genomic divergence associated with habitat, dietary preferences and post-zygotic reproductive isolation. Our findings are consistent with expansion of small founder groups into novel niches by an initial plastic behavioural response, perpetuated by social learning imposing an altered natural selection regime. The study constitutes an important step towards an understanding of the complex interaction between demographic history, culture, ecological adaptation and evolution at the genomic level.},

As new species form, they may create new niches for others to exploit, potentially catalyzing a chain reaction of speciation events across trophic levels. We tested for such sequential radiation in the Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) complex, a model for sympatric speciation via host plant shifting. We report that the parasitic wasp Diachasma alloeum (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) has formed new incipient species as a result of specializing on diversifying fly hosts, including the recently derived apple-infesting race of R. pomonella. Furthermore, we show that traits that differentially adapt R. pomonella flies to their host plants have also quickly evolved and serve as ecological barriers to reproduction, isolating the wasps. Speciation therefore cascades as the effects of new niche construction move across trophic levels.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modification of DNA via methylation is one of the key inventions in eukaryotic evolution. It provides a source for the switching of gene activities, the maintenance of stable phenotypes and the integration of environmental and genomic signals. Although this process is widespread among eukaryotes, both the patterns of methylation and their relevant biological roles not only vary noticeably in different lineages, but often are poorly understood. In addition, the evolutionary origins of DNA methylation in multicellular organisms remain enigmatic. Here we used a new epigenetic model, the social honey bee Apis mellifera, to gain insights into the significance of methylated genes. RESULTS: We combined microarray profiling of several tissues with genome-scale bioinformatics and bisulfite sequencing of selected genes to study the honey bee methylome. We find that around 35\% of the annotated honey bee genes are expected to be methylated at the CpG dinucleotides by a highly conserved DNA methylation system. We show that one unifying feature of the methylated genes in this species is their broad pattern of expression and the associated 'housekeeping' roles. In contrast, genes involved in more stringently regulated spatial or temporal functions are predicted to be un-methylated. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that honey bees use CpG methylation of intragenic regions as an epigenetic mechanism to control the levels of activity of the genes that are broadly expressed and might be needed for conserved core biological processes in virtually every type of cell. We discuss the implications of our findings for genome-scale regulatory network structures and the evolution of the role(s) of DNA methylation in eukaryotes. Our findings are particularly important in the context of the emerging evidence that environmental factors can influence the epigenetic settings of some genes and lead to serious metabolic and behavioural disorders.},

  Abstract                 = {Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins compose a family of nuclear-encoded transcriptional regulators of cytoplasmic genes. They have shown dramatic expansion in copy number in plants, and although the functional importance of many remains unclear, a subset has been repeatedly implicated as nuclear restorers for cytoplasmic male sterility. Here we investigate the molecular population genetics and molecular evolution of seven single-copy PPR genes in the outcrossing model plant Arabidopsis lyrata. In comparison with neutral reference loci, we find, on average, elevated levels of polymorphism and an excess of high-frequency variants at these PPR genes, suggesting that natural selection is maintaining polymorphism at some of these loci. This elevation in diversity persists when we control for divergence and generally decreases in the flanking regions, suggesting that these genes are themselves the targets of selection. Some of the PPR genes also demonstrate elevated population differentiation, which is consistent with spatially varying selection. In contrast, no comparable patterns are observed at these loci in A. thaliana, providing no evidence for the action of balancing selection in this selfing species. Taken together, these results suggest that a subset of PPR genes may be subject to balancing selection associated with ongoing cytonuclear coevolution in the outcrossing A. lyrata, which is possibly mediated either by intergenomic conflict or by compensatory evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Evidence suggests that female preferences may sometimes arise through sensory bias, and that males may subsequently evolve traits that increase their conspicuousness to females. Here, we ask whether indirect selection, arising through genetic associations (linkage disequilibrium) during the sexual selection that sensory bias imposes, can itself influence the evolution of preference strength. Specifically, we use population genetic models to consider whether or not modifiers of preference strength can spread under different ecological conditions when female mate choice is driven by sensory bias. We focus on male traits that make a male more conspicuous in certain habitats-and thus both more visible to predators and more attractive to females-and examine modifiers of the strength of preference for conspicuous males. We first solve for the rate of spread of a modifier that strengthens preference within an environmentally uniform population; we illustrate that this spread will be extremely slow. Second, we used a series of simulations to consider the role of habitat structure and movement on the evolution of a modifier of preference strength, using male color polymorphisms as a case study. We find that in most cases, indirect selection does not allow the evolution of stronger or weaker preferences for sensory bias. Only in a "two-island" model, where there is restricted migration between different patches that favor different male phenotypes, did we find that preference strength could evolve. The role of indirect selection in the evolution of sensory bias is of particular interest because of ongoing speculation regarding the role of sensory bias in the evolution of reproductive isolation.},

Since these artificial FASTQs are derived from the reference genome, it provides a gold-standard for read-alignment and variant-calling, thereby enabling the performance of any NGS pipeline to be evaluated. The user can customise DNA template/read length, the modelling of coverage based on GC content, whether to use real Phred base quality scores taken from existing FASTQ files, and whether to simulate sequencing errors. Detailed coverage and error summary statistics are outputted.

  Abstract                 = {Removal of top predators from ecosystems can result in cascading effects through the trophic levels below, completely restructuring the food web. Cascades have been observed in small-scale or simple food webs, but not in large, complex, open-ocean ecosystems. Using data spanning many decades from a once cod-dominated northwest Atlantic ecosystem, we demonstrate a trophic cascade in a large marine ecosystem. Several cod stocks in other geographic areas have also collapsed without recovery, suggesting the existence of trophic cascades in these systems.},

Taxonomists classify these organisms into species in much the same way as they classify eukaryotes, but differences in their biology--including horizontal gene transfer between distantly related taxa and variable rates of homologous recombination--mean that we still do not understand what a bacterial species is. This is not merely a semantic question; evolutionary theory should be able to explain why species exist at all levels of the tree of life, and we need to be able to define species for practical applications in industry, agriculture, and medicine. Recent studies have emphasized the need to combine genetic diversity and distinct ecology in an attempt to define species in a coherent and convincing fashion. The resulting data may help to discriminate among the many theories of prokaryotic species that have been produced to date.},

We disagree with this conclusion. We list a number of distortions of the original Hurlbert paper that are found in Schank and Koehnle. In addition, we note that some of the original suggestions in Hurlbert are no longer valid because statistical techniques have inevitably evolved to provide stronger tests than were available 25 years ago.},

The increased risk because of inheriting African ancestry is greater in men diagnosed before 72 years of age (P < 0.00032) and may contribute to the epidemiological observation that the higher risk for prostate cancer in African Americans is greatest in younger men (and attenuates with older age). The same region was recently identified through linkage analysis of prostate cancer, followed by fine-mapping. We strongly replicated this association (P < 4.2 x 10(-9)) but find that the previously described alleles do not explain more than a fraction of the admixture signal. Thus, admixture mapping indicates a major, still-unidentified risk gene for prostate cancer at 8q24, motivating intense work to find it.},

Such approaches are increasingly being applied to genomics data, where functional linkages are used to connect genes or proteins. However, while microarray gene expression datasets are now abundant and of high quality, few approaches have been developed for analysis of such data in a network context. We present a novel approach for 3-D visualisation and analysis of transcriptional networks generated from microarray data. These networks consist of nodes representing transcripts connected by virtue of their expression profile similarity across multiple conditions. Analysing genome-wide gene transcription across 61 mouse tissues, we describe the unusual topography of the large and highly structured networks produced, and demonstrate how they can be used to visualise, cluster, and mine large datasets. This approach is fast, intuitive, and versatile, and allows the identification of biological relationships that may be missed by conventional analysis techniques.

  Abstract                 = {In European fisheries, most stocks are overfished and many are below safe biological limits, resulting in a call from the European Commission for new long-term fisheries management plans. Here, we propose a set of intuitive harvest control rules that are economically sound, compliant with international fishery agreements, based on relevant international experiences, supportive of ecosystem-based fisheries management and compatible with the biology of the fish stocks. The rules are based on the concept of maximum sustainable yield (MSY), with a precautionary target biomass that is 30% larger than that which produces MSY and with annual catches of 91%MSY. Allowable catches decline steeply when stocks fall below MSY levels and are set to zero when stocks fall below half of MSY levels. We show that the proposed rules could have prevented the collapse of the North Sea herring in the 1970s and that they can deal with strong cyclic variations in recruitment such as known for blue whiting. Compared to the current system, these rules would lead to higher long-term catches from larger stocks at lower cost and with less adverse environmental impact.},

  Abstract                 = {In populations of phytophagous insects that use the host plant as a rendezvous for mating, divergence in host preference could lead to sympatric speciation. Speciation requires the elimination of "generalist" genotypes, that is, those with intermediate host preference. This could occur because such genotypes have an inherent fitness disadvantage, or because preference alleles become associated with alleles that are oppositely selected on the two hosts. Although the former mechanism has been shown to be plausible, the latter mechanism has not been studied in detail. I consider a multilocus model (the "Bush model") in which one set of biallelic loci affects host preference, and a second set affects viability on the hosts once chosen. Alleles that increase viability on one host decrease viability on the other, and all loci are assumed to be unlinked. With moderately strong selection on the viability loci, preference alleles rapidly become associated with viability alleles, and the population splits into two reproductively isolated host specialist populations. The conditions for speciation to occur in this model, as measured by the strength of selection required, are somewhat more stringent than in a model in which preference and viability are controlled by the same loci (one-trait model). In contrast, the conditions are much less stringent than in a model in which speciation requires buildup of associations between viability loci and loci controlling a host-independent assortative mating trait (canonical two-trait model). Moreover, in the one-trait model, and to a lesser extent the Bush model, the strength of selection needed to initiate speciation is only slightly greater than that needed to complete it. This indicates that documenting instances of sympatric species that are reproductively isolated only by host or habitat preference would provide evidence for the plausibility of sympatric speciation in nature.},

We report here that this assumption does not hold true in maize. We have sequenced over 100 kb from the bz genomic region of two different maize lines and have found dramatic differences between them. First, the retrotransposon clusters, which comprise most of the repetitive DNA in maize, differ markedly in make-up and location relative to the genes in the bz region. Second, and more importantly, the genes themselves differ between the two lines, demonstrating that genetic microcolinearity can be violated within the same species. Our finding has bearing on the underlying genetic basis of hybrid vigor in maize, and possibly other organisms, and on the measurement of genetic distances.},

In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to ∼24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to ∼8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions.http://cd-hit.org.liwz@sdsc.eduSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
  Comment                  = {The basic CD-HIT algorithm sorts the input sequences from long to short, and processes them sequentially from the longest to shortest. The first is automatically classified as the first cluster representative sequence. If this cannot be replaced by sorting by read count, then CD-HIT's clustering would very much depend on the random sorting of reads in unsorted input files from illumina with equal read lengths. But CD-HIT-est was used in comparisons with starcode. CD-HIT employs a heuristic filtering algorithms based on words (i. e. kmers) very similar to Uclust in order to reduce the number of banded NW alignments to perform for accurate edit distance determination.

We define the size of a mutation to be the number of sequences in the sample that inherits the mutant nucleotide and the type of mutation (segregating site) to be the smallest value of the frequencies of segregating nucleotides. Each of these two classifications of mutations is analogous to allelic types in a sample of genes. Assuming the neutral Wright-Fisher model, we derived in this paper the mean and variance of the frequency of mutations of each size and type, and the covariance between the numbers of mutations of two different sizes and two different types. Potential applications of these results are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Mutations resulting in segregating sites of a sample of DNA sequences can be classified by size and type and the frequencies of mutations of different sizes and types can be inferred from the sample. A framework for estimating the essential parameter theta = 4Nu utilizing the frequencies of mutations of various sizes and types is developed in this paper, where N is the effective size of a population and mu is mutation rate per sequence per generation. The framework is a combination of coalescent theory, general linear model and Monte-Carlo integration, which leads to two new estimators theta xi and theta eta as well as a general Watterson&#039;s estimator theta K and a general Tajima&#039;s estimator theta tau. The greatest strength of the framework is that it can be used under a variety of population models. The properties of the framework and the four estimators theta K, theta tau, theta xi and theta eta are investigated under three important population models: the neutral Wright-Fisher model, the neutral model with recombination and the neutral Wright&#039;s finite-islands model. Under all these models, it is shown that theta xi is the best estimator among the four even when recombination rate or migration rate has to be estimated. Under the neutral Wright-Fisher model, it is shown that the new estimator theta xi has a variance close to a lower bound of variances of all unbiased estimators of theta which suggests that theta xi is a very efficient estimator.},

We study two related problems, using the maximum likelihood method and the theory of coalescence. One problem is the potential improvement of accuracy in estimating the parameter theta over existing methods and the other is the estimation of parameter lambda which is the ratio of two theta&#039;s. The minimum variances of estimates of the parameter theta are derived under two idealized situations. These minimum variances serve as the lower bounds of the variances of all possible estimates of theta in practice. We then show that Watterson&#039;s estimate of theta based on the number of segregating sites is asymptotically an optimal estimate of theta. However, for a finite sample of sequences, substantial improvement over Watterson&#039;s estimate is possible when theta is large. The maximum likelihood estimate of lambda = theta 1/theta 2 is obtained and the properties of the estimate are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Comprehensive understanding of functional elements in the human genome will require thorough interrogation and comparison of individual human genomes and genomic structures. Such an endeavor will require improvements in the throughputs and costs of DNA sequencing. Next-generation sequencing platforms have impressively low costs and high throughputs but are limited by short read lengths. An immediate and widely recognized solution to this critical limitation is the paired-end tag (PET) sequencing for various applications, collectively called the PET sequencing strategy, in which short and paired tags are extracted from the ends of long DNA fragments for ultra-high-throughput sequencing. The PET sequences can be accurately mapped to the reference genome, thus demarcating the genomic boundaries of PET-represented DNA fragments and revealing the identities of the target DNA elements. PET protocols have been developed for the analyses of transcriptomes, transcription factor binding sites, epigenetic sites such as histone modification sites, and genome structures. The exclusive advantage of the PET technology is its ability to uncover linkages between the two ends of DNA fragments. Using this unique feature, unconventional fusion transcripts, genome structural variations, and even molecular interactions between distant genomic elements can be unraveled by PET analysis. Extensive use of PET data could lead to efficient assembly of individual human genomes, transcriptomes, and interactomes, enabling new biological and clinical insights. With its versatile and powerful nature for DNA analysis, the PET sequencing strategy has a bright future ahead.},

These primer pairs amplified 94 loci, 57 (61\%) of which segregated in a single F(1) intercross family among 83 F(2) progeny. This allowed us to produce a dense linkage map of one marker every 2 cM distributed over a total length of 134 cM. Many A. aegypti cDNAs were highly similar to genes in the Drosophila melanogaster genome project. Comparative linkage analysis revealed areas of synteny between the two species.

  Abstract                 = {<p>Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have dramatically revolutionised research in many fields of genetics. The ability to sequence many individuals from one or multiple populations at a genomic scale has greatly enhanced population genetics studies and made it a data-driven discipline. Recently, researchers have proposed statistical modelling to address genotyping uncertainty associated with NGS data. However, an ongoing debate is whether it is more beneficial to increase the number of sequenced individuals or the per-sample sequencing depth for estimating genetic variation. Through extensive simulations, I assessed the accuracy of estimating nucleotide diversity, detecting polymorphic sites, and predicting population structure under different experimental scenarios. Results show that the greatest accuracy for estimating population genetics parameters is achieved by employing a large sample size, despite single individuals being sequenced at low depth. Under some circumstances, the minimum sequencing depth for obtaining accurate estimates of allele frequencies and to identify polymorphic sites is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0079667.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where both alleles are more likely to have been sequenced. On the other hand, inferences of population structure are more accurate at very large sample sizes, even with extremely low sequencing depth. This all points to the conclusion that under various experimental scenarios, in cost-limited population genetics studies, large sample sizes at low sequencing depth are desirable to achieve high accuracy. These findings will help researchers design their experimental set-ups and guide further investigation on the effect of protocol design for genetic research.</p>},

However, the use of these sequencing technologies is often challenged by errors and biases associated with the bioinformatical methods used for analyzing the data. In particular, the use of naïve methods to identify polymorphic sites and infer genotypes can inflate downstream analyses. Recently, explicit modeling of genotype probability distributions has been proposed as a method for taking genotype call uncertainty into account. Based on this idea, we propose a novel method for quantifying population genetic differentiation from next-generation sequencing data. In addition, we present a strategy for investigating population structure via principal components analysis. Through extensive simulations, we compare the new method herein proposed to approaches based on genotype calling and demonstrate a marked improvement in estimation accuracy for a wide range of conditions. We apply the method to a large-scale genomic data set of domesticated and wild silkworms sequenced at low coverage. We find that we can infer the fine-scale genetic structure of the sampled individuals, suggesting that employing this new method is useful for investigating the genetic relationships of populations sampled at low coverage.},

  Abstract                 = {This study tests how divergent natural selection promotes genomic differentiation during ecological speciation. Specifically, we use adaptive ecological divergence (here, population divergence in host plant use and preference) as a proxy for selection strength and evaluate the correlation between levels of adaptive and genetic differentiation across pairwise population comparisons. Positive correlations would reveal the pattern predicted by our hypothesis, that of 'isolation by adaptation' (IBA). Notably, IBA is predicted not only for selected loci but also for neutral loci. This may reflect the effects of divergent selection on neutral loci that are 'loosely linked' to divergently selected loci or on geneflow restriction that facilitates genetic drift at all loci, including neutral loci that are completely unlinked to those evolving under divergent selection. Here, we evaluate IBA in maple- and willow-associated populations of Neochlamisus bebbianae leaf beetles. To do so, we collected host preference data to construct adaptive divergence indices and used AFLPs (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) and mitochondrial sequences to quantify genetic differentiation. Partial Mantel tests showed significant IBA in 'pooled' analyses of putatively neutral and of putatively selected ('outlier') AFLP loci. This pattern was also recovered in 12\% of 'locus-specific' analyses that separately evaluated genetic differentiation at individual neutral loci. These results provided evidence for widespread effects of selection on neutral genomic divergence. Our collective findings indicate that host-related selection may play important roles in the population genomic differentiation of both neutral and selected gene regions in herbivorous insects.},

  Abstract                 = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) is about to revolutionize genetic analysis. Currently NGS techniques are mainly used to sequence individual genomes. Due to the high sequence coverage required, the costs for population-scale analyses are still too high to allow an extension to nonmodel organisms. Here, we show that NGS of pools of individuals is often more effective in SNP discovery and provides more accurate allele frequency estimates, even when taking sequencing errors into account. We modify the population genetic estimators Tajima's ? and Watterson's to obtain unbiased estimates from NGS pooling data. Given the same sequencing effort, the resulting estimators often show a better performance than those obtained from individual sequencing. Although our analysis also shows that NGS of pools of individuals will not be preferable under all circumstances, it provides a cost-effective approach to estimate allele frequencies on a genome-wide scale.},

  Abstract                 = {Comparing allele frequencies among populations that differ in environment has long been a tool for detecting loci involved in local adaptation. However, such analyses are complicated by an imperfect knowledge of population allele frequencies and neutral correlations of allele frequencies among populations due to shared population history and gene flow. Here we develop a set of methods to robustly test for unusual allele frequency patterns and correlations between environmental variables and allele frequencies while accounting for these complications based on a Bayesian model previously implemented in the software Bayenv. Using this model, we calculate a set of âstandardized allele frequenciesâ that allows investigators to apply tests of their choice to multiple populations while accounting for sampling and covariance due to population history. We illustrate this first by showing that these standardized frequencies can be used to detect nonparametric correlations with environmental variables; these correlations are also less prone to spurious results due to outlier populations. We then demonstrate how these standardized allele frequencies can be used to construct a test to detect SNPs that deviate strongly from neutral population structure. This test is conceptually related to FST and is shown to be more powerful, as we account for population history. We also extend the model to next-generation sequencing of population poolsâa cost-efficient way to estimate population allele frequencies, but one that introduces an additional level of sampling noise. The utility of these methods is demonstrated in simulations and by reanalyzing human SNP data from the Human Genome Diversity Panel populations and pooled next-generation sequencing data from Atlantic herring. An implementation of our method is available from http://gcbias.org.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimating the rate of exchange of individuals among populations is a central concern to evolutionary ecology and its applications to conservation and management. For instance, the efficiency of protected areas in sustaining locally endangered populations and ecosystems depends on reserve network connectivity. The population genetics theory offers a powerful framework for estimating dispersal distances and migration rates from molecular data. In the marine realm, however, decades of molecular studies have met limited success in inferring genetic connectivity, due to the frequent lack of spatial genetic structure in species exhibiting high fecundity and dispersal capabilities. This is especially true within biogeographic regions bounded by well-known hotspots of genetic differentiation. Here, we provide an overview of the current methods for estimating genetic connectivity using molecular markers and propose several directions for improving existing approaches using large population genomic datasets. We highlight several issues that limit the effectiveness of methods based on neutral markers when there is virtually no genetic differentiation among samples. We then focus on alternative methods based on markers influenced by selection. Although some of these methodologies are still underexplored, our aim was to stimulate new research to test how broadly they are applicable to nonmodel marine species. We argue that the increased ability to apply the concepts of cline analyses will improve dispersal inferences across physical and ecological barriers that reduce connectivity locally. We finally present how neutral markers hitchhiking with selected loci can also provide information about connectivity patterns within apparently well-mixed biogeographic regions. We contend that one of the most promising applications of population genomics is the use of outlier loci to delineate relevant conservation units and related eco-geographic features across which connectivity can be measured.},

  Abstract                 = {During speciation-with-gene-flow, effective migration varies across the genome as a function of several factors, including proximity of selected loci, recombination rate, strength of selection, and number of selected loci. Genome scans may provide better empirical understanding of the genome-wide patterns of genetic differentiation, especially if the variance due to the previously mentioned factors is partitioned. In North American lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), glacial lineages that diverged in allopatry about 60,000 years ago and came into contact 12,000 years ago have independently evolved in several lakes into two sympatric species pairs (a normal benthic and a dwarf limnetic). Variable degrees of reproductive isolation between species pairs across lakes offer a continuum of genetic and phenotypic divergence associated with adaptation to distinct ecological niches. To disentangle the complex array of genetically based barriers that locally reduce the effective migration rate between whitefish species pairs, we compared genome-wide patterns of divergence across five lakes distributed along this divergence continuum. Using restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, we combined genetic mapping and population genetics approaches to identify genomic regions resistant to introgression and derive empirical measures of the barrier strength as a function of recombination distance. We found that the size of the genomic islands of differentiation was influenced by the joint effects of linkage disequilibrium maintained by selection on many loci, the strength of ecological niche divergence, as well as demographic characteristics unique to each lake. Partial parallelism in divergent genomic regions likely reflected the combined effects of polygenic adaptation from standing variation and independent changes in the genetic architecture of postzygotic isolation. This study illustrates how integrating genetic mapping and population genomics of multiple sympatric species pairs provide a window on the speciation-with-gene-flow mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {Polyploidy is a widespread phenomenon throughout eukaryotes, with important ecological and evolutionary consequences. Although genes operate as components of complex pathways and networks, polyploid changes in genes and gene expression have typically been evaluated as either individual genes or as a part of broad-scale analyses. Network analysis has been fruitful in associating genomic and other ‚Äòomic‚Äô-based changes with phenotype for many systems. In polyploid species, network analysis has the potential not only to facilitate a better understanding of the complex ‚Äòomic‚Äô underpinnings of phenotypic and ecological traits common to polyploidy, but also to provide novel insight into the interaction among duplicated genes and genomes. This adds perspective to the global patterns of expression (and other ‚Äòomic‚Äô) change that accompany polyploidy and to the patterns of recruitment and/or loss of genes following polyploidization. While network analysis in polyploid species faces challenges common to other analyses of duplicated genomes, present technologies combined with thoughtful experimental design provide a powerful system to explore polyploid evolution. Here, we demonstrate the utility and potential of network analysis to questions pertaining to polyploidy with an example involving evolution of the transgressively superior cotton fibres found in polyploid Gossypium hirsutum. By combining network analysis with prior knowledge, we provide further insights into the role of profilins in fibre domestication and exemplify the potential for network analysis in polyploid species.},

Third codon position GC content, however, is influenced by both neutral forces (e.g., mutation bias) and natural selection for codon usage optimization. In this article, large data sets of noncoding DNA sequence polymorphism in D. melanogaster and D. simulans were gathered from public databases to try to disentangle these two factors-noncoding sequences are not affected by selection for codon usage. Allele frequency analyses revealed an asymmetric pattern of AT vs. GC noncoding polymorphisms: AT --> GC mutations are less numerous, and tend to segregate at a higher frequency, than GC --> AT ones, especially at GC-rich loci. This is indicative of nonstationary evolution of base composition and/or of GC-biased allele transmission. Fitting population genetics models to the allele frequency spectra confirmed this result and favored the hypothesis of a biased transmission. These results, together with previous reports, suggest that GC-biased gene conversion has influenced base composition evolution in Drosophila and explain the correlation between intron and exon GC content.},

In Drosophila, there are around 60 loci of each type and it is thought that ecological specialization influences repertoire size, with increased pseudogenization of loci. Here, we analyse the size of the gustatory and olfactory repertoires among the genomes of 12 species of Drosophila. We find that repertoire size varies substantially and the loci are evolving by duplication and pseudogenization, with striking examples of lineage-specific duplication. Selection analyses imply that the majority of loci are subject to purifying selection, but this is less strong in gustatory loci and in loci prone to duplication. In contrast to some other studies, we find that few loci show statistically significant evidence of positive selection. Overall genome size is strongly correlated with the proportion of duplicated chemoreceptor loci, but genome size, specialization and endemism may be interrelated in their influence on repertoire size.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Gene families typically evolve by gene duplication followed by the adoption of new or altered gene functions. A different way to evolve new but related functions is alternative splicing of existing exons of a complex gene. The chemosensory gene families of animals are characterised by numerous loci of related function. Alternative splicing has only rarely been reported in chemosensory loci, for example in 5 out of around 120 loci in Drosophila melanogaster. The gustatory receptor gene Gr39a has four large exons that are alternatively spliced with three small conserved exons. Recently the genome sequences of eleven additional species of Drosophila have become available allowing us to examine variation in the structure of the Gr39a locus across a wide phylogenetic range of fly species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We describe a fifth exon and show that the locus has a complex evolutionary history with several duplications, pseudogenisations and losses of exons. PAML analyses suggested that the whole gene has a history of purifying selection, although this was less strong in exons which underwent duplication. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Estimates of functional divergence between exons were similar in magnitude to functional divergence between duplicated genes, suggesting that exon divergence is broadly equivalent to gene duplication.},

  Abstract                 = {Chemoperception plays a key role in adaptation and speciation in animals, and the senses of olfaction and gustation are mediated by gene families which show large variation in repertoire size among species. In Drosophila, there are around 60 loci of each type and it is thought that ecological specialization influences repertoire size, with increased pseudogenization of loci. Here, we analyse the size of the gustatory and olfactory repertoires among the genomes of 12 species of Drosophila. We find that repertoire size varies substantially and the loci are evolving by duplication and pseudogenization, with striking examples of lineage-specific duplication. Selection analyses imply that the majority of loci are subject to purifying selection, but this is less strong in gustatory loci and in loci prone to duplication. In contrast to some other studies, we find that few loci show statistically significant evidence of positive selection. Overall genome size is strongly correlated with the proportion of duplicated chemoreceptor loci, but genome size, specialization and endemism may be interrelated in their influence on repertoire size. },

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies are facilitating large-scale association studies of rare genetic variants. The depth of the sequence read coverage is an important experimental variable in the next-generation technologies and it is a major determinant of the quality of genotype calls generated from sequence data. When case and control samples are sequenced separately or in different proportions across batches, they are unlikely to be matched on sequencing read depth and a differential misclassification of genotypes can result, causing confounding and an increased false-positive rate. Data from Pilot Study 3 of the 1000 Genomes project was used to demonstrate that a difference between the mean sequencing read depth of case and control samples can result in false-positive association for rare and uncommon variants, even when the mean coverage depth exceeds 30× in both groups. The degree of the confounding and inflation in the false-positive rate depended on the extent to which the mean depth was different in the case and control groups. A logistic regression model was used to test for association between case-control status and the cumulative number of alleles in a collapsed set of rare and uncommon variants. Including each individual's mean sequence read depth across the variant sites in the logistic regression model nearly eliminated the confounding effect and the inflated false-positive rate. Furthermore, accounting for the potential error by modeling the probability of the heterozygote genotype calls in the regression analysis had a relatively minor but beneficial effect on the statistical results.},

  Abstract                 = {Inexpensive short-read sequencing technologies applied to reduced representation genomes is revolutionizing genetic research, especially population genetics analysis, by allowing the genotyping of massive numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for large numbers of individuals and populations. Restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing is a recent technique based on the characterization of genomic regions flanking restriction sites. One of its potential drawbacks is the presence of polymorphism within the restriction site, which makes it impossible to observe the associated SNP allele (i.e. allele dropout, ADO). To investigate the effect of ADO on genetic variation estimated from RAD markers, we first mathematically derived measures of the effect of ADO on allele frequencies as a function of different parameters within a single population. We then used RAD data sets simulated using a coalescence model to investigate the magnitude of biases induced by ADO on the estimation of expected heterozygosity and F(ST) under a simple demographic model of divergence between two populations. We found that ADO tends to overestimate genetic variation both within and between populations. Assuming a mutation rate per nucleotide between 10(-9) and 10(-8) , this bias remained low for most studied combinations of divergence time and effective population size, except for large effective population sizes. Averaging F(ST) values over multiple SNPs, for example, by sliding window analysis, did not correct ADO biases. We briefly discuss possible solutions to filter the most problematic cases of ADO using read coverage to detect markers with a large excess of null alleles.},

  Abstract                 = {Theoretical studies of speciation have been dominated by numerical simulations aiming to demonstrate that speciation in a certain scenario may occur. What is needed now is a shift in focus to identifying more general rules and patterns in the dynamics of speciation. The crucial step in achieving this goal is the development of simple and general dynamical models that can be studied not only numerically but analytically as well. I review some of the existing analytical results on speciation. I first show why the classical theories of speciation by peak shifts across adaptive valleys driven by random genetic drift run into trouble (and into what kind of trouble). Then I describe the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) model of speciation that does not require overcoming selection. I describe exactly how the probability of speciation, the average waiting time to speciation, and the average duration of speciation depend on the mutation and migration rates, population size, and selection for local adaptation. The BDM model postulates a rather specific genetic architecture of reproductive isolation. I then show exactly why the genetic architecture required by the BDM model should be common in general. Next I consider the multilocus generalizations of the BDM model again concentrating on the qualitative characteristics of speciation such as the average waiting time to speciation and the average duration of speciation. Finally, I consider two models of sympatric speciation in which the conditions for sympatric speciation were found analytically. A number of important conclusions have emerged from analytical studies. Unless the population size is small and the adaptive valley is shallow, the waiting time to a stochastic transition between the adaptive peaks is extremely long. However, if transition does happen, it is very quick. Speciation can occur by mutation and random drift alone with no contribution from selection as different populations accumulate incompatible genes. The importance of mutations and drift in speciation is augmented by the general structure of adaptive landscapes. Speciation can be understood as the divergence along nearly neutral networks and holey adaptive landscapes (driven by mutation, drift, and selection for adaptation to a local biotic and/or abiotic environment) accompanied by the accumulation of reproductive isolation as a by-product. The waiting time to speciation driven by mutation and drift is typically very long. Selection for local adaptation (either acting directly on the loci underlying reproductive isolation via their pleiotropic effects or acting indirectly via establishing a genetic barrier to gene flow) can significantly decrease the waiting time to speciation. In the parapatric case the average actual duration of speciation is much shorter than the average waiting time to speciation. Speciation is expected to be triggered by changes in the environment. Once genetic changes underlying speciation start, they go to completion very rapidly. Sympatric speciation is possible if disruptive selection and/or assortativeness in mating are strong enough. Sympatric speciation is promoted if costs of being choosy are small (or absent) and if linkage between the loci experiencing disruptive selection and those controlling assortative mating is strong.},

  Abstract                 = {Dobzhansky's model of epistatic selection assumes that viable genotypes form 'clusters' in genotype space so that populations can evolve from one state to a reproductively isolated state following a 'ridge' of well-fit genotypes without crossing any deep adaptive valleys. Recently, the importance of Dobzhansky-type models in evolutionary studies has been reemphasized by Gavrilets (1997a) and Gavrilets and Gravner (1997) who argue that the existence of 'ridges' of well-fit genotypes connecting reproductively isolated genotypes is actually a general property of multidimensional adaptive landscapes. Using rigorous techniques and numerical simulations, I analyze clines in the frequencies of selected and neutral alleles maintained by a balance of migration and Dobzhansky-type epistatic selection acting on two diallelic loci. I show that Dobzhansky-type epistatic selection can build up a very strong barrier to neutral gene flow. I describe properties of clines that are indicative of Dobzhansky-type selection.},

  Abstract                 = {A classical view of speciation is that reproductive isolation arises as a by-product of genetic divergence. Here, individual-based simulations are used to evaluate whether the mechanisms implied by this view may result in rapid speciation if the only source of genetic divergence are mutation and random genetic drift. Distinctive features of the simulations are the consideration of the complete process of speciation (from initiation until completion), and of a large number of loci, which was only one order of magnitude smaller than that of bacteria. It is demonstrated that rapid speciation on the time-scale of hundreds of generations is plausible without the need for extreme founder events, complete geographic isolation, the existence of distinct adaptive peaks or selection for local adaptation. The plausibility of speciation is enhanced by population subdivision. Simultaneous emergence of more than two new species from a subdivided population is highly probable. Numerical examples relevant to the theory of centrifugal speciation and to the conjectures about the fate of 'ring species' and 'sexual continuums' are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Biologists have long been fascinated by the exceptionally high diversity displayed by some evolutionary groups. Adaptive radiation in such clades is not only spectacular, but is also an extremely complex process influenced by a variety of ecological, genetic, and developmental factors and strongly dependent on historical contingencies. Using modeling approaches, we identify 10 general patterns concerning the temporal, spatial, and genetic/morphological properties of adaptive radiation. Some of these are strongly supported by empirical work, whereas for others, empirical support is more tentative. In almost all cases, more data are needed. Future progress in our understanding of adaptive radiation will be most successful if theoretical and empirical approaches are integrated, as has happened in other areas of evolutionary biology.},

Our results show that relatively rapid (<20,000 generations) colonization of a new ecological niche and (sympatric or parapatric) speciation via local adaptation and divergence in habitat and mating preferences are theoretically plausible if: (i) the number of loci underlying the traits controlling local adaptation, and habitat and mating preferences is small; (ii) the strength of selection for local adaptation is intermediate; (iii) the carrying capacity of the population is intermediate; and (iv) the effects of the loci influencing nonrandom mating are strong. We discuss patterns and timescales of ecological speciation identified by our model, and we highlight important parameters and features that need to be studied empirically to provide information that can be used to improve the biological realism and power of mathematical models of ecological speciation.},

We used the pattern of neutral genetic differentiation at nine microsatellite loci (F(ST)) as an indicator of expected changes under neutral processes and compared it with phenotypic differentiation (P(ST)) for a large number of traits (size, plumage melanism and coloration of bare parts). Even assuming very low heritability, interspecific divergence between L. glaucescens and L. occidentalis in plumage melanism and orbital ring colour clearly exceeded neutral differentiation. Similarly, melanism of the central primaries was highly divergent between L. argentatus and L. cachinnans. Such divergence is unlikely to have arisen randomly and is therefore attributed to spatially varying selection. Variation in plumage melanism in both transects agrees with Gloger's rule, which suggests that latitude (and associated sun and humidity gradients) could be the selective pressure shaping differentiation in plumage melanism. We suggest that strong species differentiation in orbital ring colour results from sexual selection. We conclude that these large gull species, along with other recently diverged species that hybridize after coming into secondary contact, may differ only in restricted regions of the genome that are undergoing strong disruptive selection because of their phenotypic effects.},

To address these problems, sequential mark‚Äîrecapture experiments are cast into a Bayesian framework using a "noninformative" discrete uniform improper prior (a priori theoretical) distribution. Some properties of the posterior distribution (probability of each population size given the data) are briefly and informally discussed (inference, convergence, mean, mode, median, and treatment of nuisance parameters). A sequential Bayes computational algorithm, suitable for microcomputers, is given. Several examples are presented as a practical guide to computing estimates. For relatively small sample sizes, the Bayesian approach yields larger mean abundance estimates than traditional methods. There is little difference in these estimates for larger sampling efforts. Advantages of the approach include the following: the probability of observing the data at all feasible population sizes is calculated exactly; the method works for all cases regardless of sample size or sampling procedure; a plot of successive posterior distributions can be used as a visual diagnostic of conformity with basic assumptions; and finally, inferences can be made directly, since the end product completely describes the uncertainty of the population size given the data.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing has opened the door to genomic analysis of nonmodel organisms. Technologies generating long-sequence reads (200–400 bp) are increasingly used in evolutionary studies of nonmodel organisms, but the short-sequence reads (30–50 bp) that can be produced at lower cost are thought to be of limited utility for de novo sequencing applications. Here, we tested this assumption by short-read sequencing the transcriptomes of the tropical disease vectors Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, for which complete genome sequences are available. Comparison of our results to the reference genomes allowed us to accurately evaluate the quantity, quality, and functional and evolutionary information content of our “test” data. We produced more than 0.7 billion nucleotides of sequenced data per species that assembled into more than 21,000 test contigs larger than 100 bp per species and covered ∼27% of the Aedes reference transcriptome. Remarkably, the substitution error rate in the test contigs was ∼0.25% per site, with very few indels or assembly errors. Test contigs of both species were enriched for genes involved in energy production and protein synthesis and underrepresented in genes involved in transcription and differentiation. Ortholog prediction using the test contigs was accurate across hundreds of millions of years of evolution. Our results demonstrate the considerable utility of short-read transcriptome sequencing for genomic studies of nonmodel organisms and suggest an approach for assessing the information content of next-generation data for evolutionary studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Reproductive isolation is an essential ingredient of speciation, and much has been learned in recent years about the evolution of reproductive isolation and the genetics of reproductive barriers in animals and plants. Fungi have been neglected on these aspects, despite being tractable model eukaryotes. Here, we used a model fitting approach to look at the importance of different barriers to gene flow to explain the decrease of reproductive compatibility with genetic distance in fungi. We found support for the occurrence of reinforcement in the presyngamy compatibility among basidiomycetes. In contrast, no evidence for reinforcement was detected in ascomycetes, concurring with the idea that host/habitat adaptation in this group can pleiotropically cause reproductive isolation. We found no evidence of a snowballing accumulation of postsyngamic reproductive incompatibilities in either ascomycetes or the complex of anther smut fungi. Together with previous studies, our results suggest that ecologically based barriers to gene flow and karyotypic differences may have an important role in hybrid inviability and sterility in fungi. Interestingly, hybrid sterility appeared to evolve faster than hybrid inviability in fungi.},

  Abstract                 = {Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) is a next generation sequencing based method that takes advantage of reduced representation to enable high throughput genotyping of large numbers of individuals at a large number of SNP markers. The relatively straightforward, robust, and cost-effective GBS protocol is currently being applied in numerous species by a large number of researchers. Herein we describe a bioinformatics pipeline, TASSEL-GBS, designed for the efficient processing of raw GBS sequence data into SNP genotypes. The TASSEL-GBS pipeline successfully fulfills the following key design criteria: (1) Ability to run on the modest computing resources that are typically available to small breeding or ecological research programs, including desktop or laptop machines with only 8-16 GB of RAM, (2) Scalability from small to extremely large studies, where hundreds of thousands or even millions of SNPs can be scored in up to 100,000 individuals (e.g., for large breeding programs or genetic surveys), and (3) Applicability in an accelerated breeding context, requiring rapid turnover from tissue collection to genotypes. Although a reference genome is required, the pipeline can also be run with an unfinished "pseudo-reference" consisting of numerous contigs. We describe the TASSEL-GBS pipeline in detail and benchmark it based upon a large scale, species wide analysis in maize (Zea mays), where the average error rate was reduced to 0.0042 through application of population genetic-based SNP filters. Overall, the GBS assay and the TASSEL-GBS pipeline provide robust tools for studying genomic diversity.},

  Abstract                 = {The genetic architecture of traits influencing sexual isolation can give insight into the evolution of reproductive isolation and hence speciation. Here we report a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of the difference in mean interpulse interval (IPI), an important component of the male courtship song, between Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia. Using a backcross analysis, we find six QTL that explain a total of 40.7\% of the phenotypic variance. Three candidate genes are located in the intervals bounded by two of the QTL and there are no significant QTL on the X chromosome. The values of mean IPI for hybrid individuals imply the presence of dominant alleles or epistasis. Because unisexual hybrid sterility prevents an F(2) analysis, we cannot distinguish dominant from additive genetic effects at the scale of QTL. A comparison with a study of QTL for intraspecific variation in D. melanogaster shows that, for these strains, the QTL we have identified for interspecific variation cannot be those that contribute to intraspecific variation. We find that the QTL have bidirectional effects, which indicates that the genetic architecture is compatible with divergence due to genetic drift, although other possibilities are discussed.},

Whereas such data can be readily used for a wide range of biomedical applications, it has proven difficult to use them to generate high-quality de novo genome assemblies of large, repeat-rich vertebrate genomes. To date, the genome assemblies generated from such data have fallen far short of those obtained with the older (but much more expensive) capillary-based sequencing approach. Here, we report the development of an algorithm for genome assembly, ALLPATHS-LG, and its application to massively parallel DNA sequence data from the human and mouse genomes, generated on the Illumina platform. The resulting draft genome assemblies have good accuracy, short-range contiguity, long-range connectivity, and coverage of the genome. In particular, the base accuracy is high (?99.95\%) and the scaffold sizes (N50 size = 11.5 Mb for human and 7.2 Mb for mouse) approach those obtained with capillary-based sequencing. The combination of improved sequencing technology and improved computational methods should now make it possible to increase dramatically the de novo sequencing of large genomes.

  Abstract                 = {The origin of species remains one of the most controversial and least understood topics in evolution. While it is being widely accepted that complete cessation of gene-flow between populations owing to long-lasting geographical barriers results in a steady, irreversible increase of divergence and eventually speciation, the extent to which various degrees of habitat heterogeneity influences speciation rates is less well understood. Here, we investigate how small, randomly distributed physical obstacles influence the distribution of populations and species, the level of population connectivity (e.g. gene flow), as well as the mode and tempo of speciation in a virtual ecosystem composed of prey and predator species. We adapted an existing individual-based platform, EcoSim, to allow fine tuning of the gene flow's level between populations by adding various numbers of obstacles in the world. The platform implements a simple food chain consisting of primary producers, herbivores (prey) and predators. It allows complex intra- and inter-specific interactions, based on individual evolving behavioural models, as well as complex predator-prey dynamics and coevolution in spatially homogenous and heterogeneous worlds. We observed a direct and continuous increase in the speed of evolution (e.g. the rate of speciation) with the increasing number of obstacles in the world. The spatial distribution of species was also more compact in the world with obstacles than in the world without obstacles. Our results suggest that environmental heterogeneity and other factors affecting demographic stochasticity can directly influence speciation and extinction rates.},

  Abstract                 = {We developed a Bayesian genomic cline model to study the genetic architecture of adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation between hybridizing lineages. This model quantifies locus-specific patterns of introgression with two cline parameters that describe the probability of locus-specific ancestry as a function of genome-wide admixture. 'Outlier' loci with extreme patterns of introgression relative to most of the genome can be identified. These loci are potentially associated with adaptive divergence or reproductive isolation. We simulated genetic data for admixed populations that included neutral introgression, as well as loci that were subject to directional, epistatic or underdominant selection, and analysed these data using the Bayesian genomic cline model. Under many demographic conditions, underdominance or directional selection had detectable and predictable effects on cline parameters, and 'outlier' loci were greatly enriched for genetic regions affected by selection. We also analysed previously published genetic data from two transects through a hybrid zone between Mus domesticus and M. musculus. We found considerable variation in rates of introgression across the genome and particularly low rates of introgression for two X-linked markers. There were similarities and differences in patterns of introgression between the two transects, which likely reflects a combination of stochastic variability because of genetic drift and geographic variation in the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation. By providing a robust framework to quantify and compare patterns of introgression among genetic regions and populations, the Bayesian genomic cline model will advance our understanding of the genetics of reproductive isolation and the speciation process.},

  Abstract                 = {The demography of populations and natural selection shape genetic variation across the genome and understanding the genomic consequences of these evolutionary processes is a fundamental aim of population genetics. We have developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to quantify genome-wide population structure and identify candidate genetic regions affected by selection. \textbf{This model improves on existing methods by accounting for stochastic sampling of sequences inherent in next-generation sequencing} (with pooled or indexed individual samples) and by incorporating genetic distances among haplotypes in measures of genetic differentiation. Using simulations we demonstrate that this model has a low false-positive rate for classifying neutral genetic regions as selected genes (i.e., ?(ST) outliers), but can detect recent selective sweeps, particularly when genetic regions in multiple populations are affected by selection. Nonetheless, selection affecting just a single population was difficult to detect and resulted in a high false-negative rate under certain conditions. We applied the Bayesian model to two large sets of human population genetic data. We found evidence of widespread positive and balancing selection among worldwide human populations, including many genetic regions previously thought to be under selection. Additionally, we identified novel candidate genes for selection, several of which have been linked to human diseases. This model will facilitate the population genetic analysis of a wide range of organisms on the basis of next-generation sequence data.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a novel method that uses natural admixture between divergent lineages (hybridization) to investigate the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation and adaptive introgression. Our method employs multinomial regression to estimate genomic clines and to quantify introgression for individual loci relative to the genomic background (clines in genotype frequency along a genomic admixture gradient). Loci with patterns of introgression that deviate significantly from null expectations based on the remainder of the genome are potentially subject to selection and thus of interest to understanding adaptation and the evolution of reproductive isolation. Using simulations, we show that different forms of selection modify these genomic clines in predictable ways and that our method has good power to detect moderate to strong selection for multiple forms of selection. Using individual-based simulations, we demonstrate that our method generally has a low false positive rate, except when genetic drift is particularly pronounced (e.g. low population size, low migration rates from parental populations, and substantial time since initial admixture). Additional individual-based simulations reveal that moderate selection against heterozygotes can be detected as much as 50 cm away from the focal locus directly experiencing selection, but is not detected at unlinked loci. Finally, we apply our analytical method to previously published data sets from a mouse (Mus musculus and M. domesticus) and two sunflower (Helianthus petiolaris and H. annuus) hybrid zones. This method should be applicable to numerous species that are currently the focus of research in evolution and ecology and should help bring about new insights regarding the processes underlying the origin and maintenance of biological diversity.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigated the extent and potential cause(s) of mitochondrial introgression within the polytypic North American Lycaeides species complex (Lepidoptera). By comparing population genetic structure based on mitochondrial DNA (COI and COII) and nuclear DNA (251 polymorphic amplified fragment length polymorphism markers), we detected substantial mito-nuclear discordance, primarily involving a single mitochondrial haplotype (h01), which is likely due to mitochondrial introgression between differentiated Lycaeides populations and/or species. We detected reduced mitochondrial genetic diversity relative to nuclear genetic diversity in populations where mitochondrial haplotype h01 occurs, suggesting that the spread of this haplotype was facilitated by selection. We found no evidence that haplotype h01 is associated with increased fitness (in terms of survival to eclosion, fresh adult weight, and adult longevity) in a polymorphic Lycaeides melissa population. However, we did find a positive association between mitochondrial haplotype h01 and infection by the endoparasitic bacterium Wolbachia in one out of three lineages tested. Linkage disequilibrium between mitochondrial haplotype h01 and Wolbachia infection status may have resulted in indirect selection favouring the spread of haplotype h01 in at least one lineage of North American Lycaeides. These results illustrate the potential for introgressive hybridization to produce substantial mito-nuclear discordance and demonstrate that an individual's mitochondrial and nuclear genome may have strikingly different evolutionary histories resulting from non-neutral processes and intrinsic differences in the inheritance and biology of these genomes.},

  Abstract                 = {The distribution of genetic variation within and among populations is commonly used to infer their demographic and evolutionary histories. This endeavour has the potential to benefit substantially from high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies through a rapid increase in the amount of data available and a corresponding increase in the precision of parameter estimation. Here we report the results of a phylogeographic study of the North American butterfly genus Lycaeides using 454 sequence data. This study serves the dual purpose of demonstrating novel molecular and analytical methods for population genetic analyses with 454 sequence data and expanding our knowledge of the phylogeographic history of Lycaeides. We obtained 341,045 sequence reads from 12 populations that we were able to assemble into 15,262 contigs (most of which were variable), representing one of the largest population genetic data sets for a non-model organism to date. We examined patterns of genetic variation using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis of molecular variance model, which provides precise estimates of genome-level phi(ST) while appropriately modelling uncertainty in locus-specific phi(ST). We found that approximately 36\% of sequence variation was partitioned among populations, suggesting historical or current isolation among the sampled populations. Estimates of pairwise genome-level phi(ST) were largely consistent with a previous phylogeographic model for Lycaeides, suggesting fragmentation into two to three refugia during Pleistocene glacial cycles followed by post-Pleistocene range expansion and secondary contact leading to introgressive hybridization. This study demonstrates the potential of using genome-level data to better understand the phylogeographic history of populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies of hybridization have increased our understanding of the nature of species boundaries, the process of speciation, and the effects of hybridization on the evolution of populations and species. In the present study we use genetic and morphological data to determine the outcome and consequences of secondary contact and hybridization between the butterfly species Lycaeides idas and L. melissa in the Rocky Mountains. Admixture proportions estimated from structure and geographical cline analysis indicate L. idas and L. melissa have hybridized extensively in the Rocky Mountains and that reproductive isolation was insufficient to prevent introgression for much of the genome. Geographical patterns of admixture suggest that hybridization between L. idas and L. melissa has led to the formation of a hybrid zone. The hybrid zone is relatively wide, given estimates of dispersal for Lycaeides butterflies, and does not show strong evidence of cline concordance among characters. We believe the structure of the Lycaeides hybrid zone might be best explained by the patchy distribution of Lycaeides, local extinction and colonization of habitat patches, environmental variation and weak overall selection against hybrids. We found no evidence that hybridization in the Rocky Mountains has resulted in the formation of independent hybrid species, in contrast to the outcome of hybridization between L. idas and L. melissa in the Sierra Nevada. Finally, our results suggest that differences in male morphology between L. idas and L. melissa might contribute to isolation, or perhaps even that selection has favoured the spread of L. melissa male genitalia alleles.},

  Abstract                 = {Genome divergence during speciation is a dynamic process that is affected by various factors, including the genetic architecture of barriers to gene flow. Herein we quantitatively describe aspects of the genetic architecture of two sets of traits, male genitalic morphology and oviposition preference, that putatively function as barriers to gene flow between the butterfly species Lycaeides idas and L. melissa. Our analyses are based on unmapped DNA sequence data and a recently developed Bayesian regression approach that includes variable selection and explicit parameters for the genetic architecture of traits. A modest number of nucleotide polymorphisms explained a small to large proportion of the variation in each trait, and average genetic variant effects were nonnegligible. Several genetic regions were associated with variation in multiple traits or with trait variation within- and among-populations. In some instances, genetic regions associated with trait variation also exhibited exceptional genetic differentiation between species or exceptional introgression in hybrids. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that divergent selection on male genitalia has contributed to heterogeneous genetic differentiation, and that both sets of traits affect fitness in hybrids. Although these results are encouraging, we highlight several difficulties related to understanding the genetics of speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {Speciation is the process by which reproductively isolated lineages arise, and is one of the fundamental means by which the diversity of life increases. Whereas numerous studies have documented an association between ecological divergence and reproductive isolation, relatively little is known about the role of natural selection in genome divergence during the process of speciation. Here, we use genome-wide DNA sequences and Bayesian models to test the hypothesis that loci under divergent selection between two butterfly species (Lycaeides idas and L. melissa) also affect fitness in an admixed population. Locus-specific measures of genetic differentiation between L. idas and L. melissa and genomic introgression in hybrids varied across the genome. The most differentiated genetic regions were characterized by elevated L. idas ancestry in the admixed population, which occurs in L. idas-like habitat, consistent with the hypothesis that local adaptation contributes to speciation. Moreover, locus-specific measures of genetic differentiation (a metric of divergent selection) were positively associated with extreme genomic introgression (a metric of hybrid fitness). Interestingly, concordance of differentiation and introgression was only partial. We discuss multiple, complementary explanations for this partial concordance.},

  Abstract                 = {Hybrid zones are common in nature and can offer critical insights into the dynamics and components of reproductive isolation. Hybrids between diverged lineages are particularly informative about the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation, because introgression in an admixed population is a direct measure of isolation. In this paper, we combine simulations and a new statistical model to determine the extent to which different genetic architectures of isolation leave different signatures on genome-level patterns of introgression. We found that reproductive isolation caused by one or several loci of large effect caused greater heterogeneity in patterns of introgression than architectures involving many loci with small fitness effects, particularly when isolating factors were closely linked. The same conditions that led to heterogeneous introgression often resulted in a reasonable correspondence between outlier loci and the genetic loci that contributed to isolation. However, demographic conditions affected both of these results, highlighting potential limitations to the study of the speciation genomics. Further progress in understanding the genomics of speciation will require large-scale empirical studies of introgression in hybrid zones and model-based analyses, as well as more comprehensive modelling of the expected levels of isolation with different demographies and genetic architectures of isolation.},

We have consequently begun to appreciate the vastness of individual genetic variation from single nucleotide to structural variants. Translation of genome-scale variation into medically useful information is, however, in its infancy. This review summarizes the initial steps undertaken in clinical implementation of personal genome information, and describes the application of whole-genome and exome sequencing to identify the cause of genetic diseases and to suggest adjuvant therapies. Better analysis tools and a deeper understanding of the biology of our genome are necessary in order to decipher, interpret, and optimize clinical utility of what the variation in the human genome can teach us.

  Abstract                 = {Since the completion of the human genome project in 2003, extraordinary progress has been made in genome sequencing technologies, which has led to a decreased cost per megabase and an increase in the number and diversity of sequenced genomes. An astonishing complexity of genome architecture has been revealed, bringing these sequencing technologies to even greater advancements. Some approaches maximize the number of bases sequenced in the least amount of time, generating a wealth of data that can be used to understand increasingly complex phenotypes. Alternatively, other approaches now aim to sequence longer contiguous pieces of DNA, which are essential for resolving structurally complex regions. These and other strategies are providing researchers and clinicians a variety of tools to probe genomes in greater depth, leading to an enhanced understanding of how genome sequence variants underlie phenotype and disease.},

Even though various models of the fate of duplicated genes have been established, current knowledge about the role of divergent selection after gene duplication is rather limited. In this study, we analyzed sequence divergence in response to neo- and subfunctionalization of segmentally duplicated genes in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana. We compared the genomes of A. thaliana and the poplar Populus trichocarpa to identify orthologous pairs of genes and their corresponding inparalogs. Maximum-likelihood analyses of the nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rate ratio [Formula: see text] of pairs of A. thaliana inparalogs were used to detect differences in the evolutionary rates of protein coding sequences. We analyzed 1,924 A. thaliana paralogous pairs and our results indicate that around 6.9\% show divergent ? values between the lineages for a fraction of sites. We observe an enrichment of regulatory sequences, a reduced level of co-expression and an increased number of substitutions that can be attributed to positive selection based on an McDonald-Kreitman type of analysis. Taken together, these results show that selection after duplication contributes substantially to gene novelties and hence functional divergence in plants.},

Current estimates suggest that whereas Drosophila, mice, and bacteria have undergone extensive adaptive evolution, hominids show little or no evidence of adaptive evolution in protein-coding sequences. This may be a consequence of differences in effective population size. To study the matter further, we have investigated whether plants show evidence of adaptive evolution using an extension of the McDonald-Kreitman test that explicitly models slightly deleterious mutations by estimating the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations. We apply this method to data from nine pairs of species. Altogether more than 2,400 loci with an average length of approximately 280 nucleotides were analyzed. We observe very similar results in all species; we find little evidence of adaptive amino acid substitution in any comparison except sunflowers. This may be because many plant species have modest effective population sizes.},

  Abstract                 = {The effective population size (N(e)) is one of the most fundamental parameters in population genetics. It is thought to vary across the genome as a consequence of differences in the rate of recombination and the density of selected sites due to the processes of genetic hitchhiking and background selection. Although it is known that there is intragenomic variation in the effective population size in some species, it is not known whether this is widespread or how much variation in the effective population size there is. Here, we test whether the effective population size varies across the genome, between protein-coding genes, in 10 eukaryotic species by considering whether there is significant variation in neutral diversity, taking into account differences in the mutation rate between loci by using the divergence between species. In most species we find significant evidence of variation. We investigate whether the variation in N(e) is correlated to recombination rate and the density of selected sites in four species, for which these data are available. We find that N(e) is positively correlated to recombination rate in one species, Drosophila melanogaster, and negatively correlated to a measure of the density of selected sites in two others, humans and Arabidopsis thaliana. However, much of the variation remains unexplained. We use a hierarchical Bayesian analysis to quantify the amount of variation in the effective population size and show that it is quite modest in all species-most genes have an N(e) that is within a few fold of all other genes. Nonetheless we show that this modest variation in N(e) is sufficient to cause significant differences in the efficiency of natural selection across the genome, by demonstrating that the ratio of the number of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphisms is significantly correlated to synonymous diversity and estimates of N(e), even taking into account the obvious nonindependence between these measures.},

We investigated acoustic mating signals and associated leg movements responsible for song creation of hybrids between the grasshopper species Chorthippus biguttulus and C. brunneus to study whether and how songs of male hybrids contribute to reproductive isolation between these sympatrically occurring species. Songs of F1, F2, and backcross hybrids were intermediate between those of both parental species in terms phrase number and duration. In contrast, species-specific syllable structure within phrases was largely lost in hybrids and was produced, if at all, in an irregular and imperfect manner. These divergences in inheritance of different song parameters are likely the result of incompatibility of neuronal networks that control stridulatory leg movements in hybrids. It is highly probable that songs of hybrid males are unattractive to females of either parental species because they are intermediate in terms of phrase duration and lack a clear syllable structure. Males of various hybrid types (F1, F2, and backcrosses) are behaviorally sterile because their songs fail to attract mates.},

  Abstract                 = {Under simple assumptions, the evolution of epistatic "Dobzhansky-Muller" incompatibilities between a pair of species should yield an accelerating decline of log overall reproductive compatibility--a "snowball" effect that might rapidly provide new species with "reality." Possible alternatives include: (1) simple exponential failure, giving a linear rate of log compatibility loss, and (2) "slowdown," likely during reinforcement in which mate choice evolves to prevent deleterious hybridization, yielding a decelerating log compatibility loss. In analyses of multiple datasets, we find little support for the snowball effect, except possibly in Lepidoptera hybrid viability. The snowball predicts a slow initial rate of incompatibility acquisition, with low initial variance; instead, highly variable compatibility is almost universally observed at low genetic distances. Another deviation from predictions is that reproductive isolation usually remains incomplete until long after speciation. These results do not disprove snowball compatibility decay, but can result if large deleterious effects are due to relatively few genetic changes, or if different types of incompatibility evolve at very different rates. On the other hand, data on Bacillus and Saccharomyces, as well as theories of chromosomal evolution, suggest that some kinds of incompatibility accumulate approximately linearly, without Dobzhansky-Muller effects. In microorganisms, linearity can result from direct negative effects of DNA sequence divergence on compatibility. Finally, a decelerating slowdown model is supported for sympatric Leptasterias starfish, and in Drosophila prezygotic isolation in sympatry but not allopatry, providing novel comparative evidence for reinforcement.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous work has suggested that developmental temperature influences expression of the adult male calling song of the cricket, a sexually selected mate recognition signal. The role of developmental temperature in shaping female preference functions, and thus its influence on signal-preference coupling has not been investigated. In this study, the effects of developmental temperature are examined in both males and females of the Hawaiian cricket, Laupala cerasina, to determine the degree of signal-preference matching between male song and female preference due to developmental environment. We found that rearing females in different temperature environments affected adult female acoustic preference functions in the same direction as male calling song, thereby influencing variation in adult reproductive behavior in such a way that male and female components remain coordinated. However, we further demonstrate that for male song, the effect of the rearing environment is not permanent but appears only to exert influence for a period of days. This mid-term temperature effect is distinct from the effect of short-term ambient temperature, which influences song in a matter of minutes and has been well documented. Signal-preference coordination, and sexual selection pressures due to mismatching within natural populations, likely will be influenced by nymphal developmental environments of males and females, as well as by adult singing and preference environments.},

  Abstract                 = {Degraded DNA from suboptimal field sampling is common in molecular ecology. However, its impact on techniques that use restriction site associated next-generation DNA sequencing (RADSeq, GBS) is unknown. We experimentally examined the effects of in situDNA degradation on data generation for a modified double-digest RADSeq approach (3RAD). We generated libraries using genomic DNA serially extracted from the muscle tissue of 8 individual lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) following 0-, 12-, 48- and 96-h incubation at room temperature posteuthanasia. This treatment of the tissue resulted in input DNA that ranged in quality from nearly intact to highly sheared. All samples were sequenced as a multiplexed pool on an Illumina MiSeq. Libraries created from low to moderately degraded DNA (12‚Äì48¬†h) performed well. In contrast, the number of RADtags per individual, number of variable sites, and percentage of identical RADtags retained were all dramatically reduced when libraries were made using highly degraded DNA (96-h group). This reduction in performance was largely due to a significant and unexpected loss of raw reads as a result of poor quality scores. Our findings remained consistent after changes in restriction enzymes, modified fold coverage values (2- to 16-fold), and additional read-length trimming. We conclude that starting DNA quality is an important consideration for RADSeq; however, the approach remains robust until genomic DNA is extensively degraded.},

Allele frequency clines are expected to form at loci under selection, but unlinked neutral alleles may pass easily across these clines unless a generalized barrier evolves. Here we consider the distribution of forms of the intertidal gastropod Littorina saxatilis, analyzing shell shape and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci on two rocky shores in Britain. On the basis of previous work, the AFLP loci were divided into differentiated and undifferentiated groups. On both shores, we have shown a sharp cline in allele frequencies between the two morphs for differentiated AFLP loci. This is coincident with a habitat transition on the shore where the two habitats (cliff and boulder field) are immediately contiguous. The allele frequency clines coincide with a cline in shell morphology. In the middle of the cline, linkage disequilibrium for the differentiated loci rises in accordance with expectation. The clines are extremely narrow relative to dispersal, probably as a result of both strong selection and habitat choice. An increase in F(ST) for undifferentiated AFLPs between morphs, relative to within-morph comparisons, is consistent with there being a general barrier to gene flow across the contact zone. These features are consistent either with an episode of allopatric divergence followed by secondary contact or with primary, nonallopatric divergence. Further data will be needed to distinguish between these alternatives.},

  Abstract                 = {Speciation, the process by which two species form from one, involves the development of reproductive isolation of two divergent lineages. Here, we report the establishment and persistence of a reproductively isolated population of Darwin's finches on the small Galápagos Island of Daphne Major in the secondary contact phase of speciation. In 1981, an immigrant medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) arrived on the island. It was unusually large, especially in beak width, sang an unusual song, and carried some Geospiza scandens alleles. We followed the fate of this individual and its descendants for seven generations over a period of 28 years. In the fourth generation, after a severe drought, the lineage was reduced to a single brother and sister, who bred with each other. From then on this lineage, inheriting unusual song, morphology, and a uniquely homozygous marker allele, was reproductively isolated, because their own descendants bred with each other and with no other member of the resident G. fortis population. These observations agree with some expectations of an ecological theory of speciation in that a barrier to interbreeding arises as a correlated effect of adaptive divergence in morphology. However, the important, culturally transmitted, song component of the barrier appears to have arisen by chance through an initial imperfect copying of local song by the immigrant. The study reveals additional stochastic elements of speciation, in which divergence is initiated in allopatry; immigration to a new area of a single male hybrid and initial breeding with a rare hybrid female.},

  Abstract                 = {The question we address in this article is how hybridization in the recent past can be detected in recently evolved species. Such species may not have evolved genetic incompatibilities and may hybridize with little or no fitness loss. Hybridization can be recognized by relatively small genetic differences between sympatric populations because sympatric populations have the opportunity to interbreed whereas allopatric populations do not. Using microsatellite DNA data from Darwin's finches in the Galapagos archipelago, we compare sympatric and allopatric genetic distances in pairs of Geospiza and Camarhynchus species. In agreement with the hybridization hypothesis, we found a statistically strong tendency for a species to be more similar genetically to a sympatric relative than to allopatric populations of that relative. Hybridization has been studied directly on two islands, but it is evidently more widespread in the archipelago. We argue that introgressive hybridization may have been a persistent feature of the adaptive radiation through most of its history, facilitating evolutionary diversification and occasionally affecting both the speed and direction of evolution.},

This claim flies in the face of current estimates according to which the fraction of the genome that is evolutionarily conserved through purifying selection is less than 10\%. Thus, according to the ENCODE Consortium, a biological function can be maintained indefinitely without selection, which implies that at least 80 - 10 = 70\% of the genome is perfectly invulnerable to deleterious mutations, either because no mutation can ever occur in these "functional" regions or because no mutation in these regions can ever be deleterious. This absurd conclusion was reached through various means, chiefly by employing the seldom used "causal role" definition of biological function and then applying it inconsistently to different biochemical properties, by committing a logical fallacy known as "affirming the consequent," by failing to appreciate the crucial difference between "junk DNA" and "garbage DNA," by using analytical methods that yield biased errors and inflate estimates of functionality, by favoring statistical sensitivity over specificity, and by emphasizing statistical significance rather than the magnitude of the effect. Here, we detail the many logical and methodological transgressions involved in assigning functionality to almost every nucleotide in the human genome.

Understanding genomic data thus requires careful modeling of historical gene flow. Here we consider the effect of relatively recent population structure and gene flow, and interpret genomes of individuals that have ancestry from multiple source populations as mosaics of segments originating from each population. This article describes general and tractable models for local ancestry patterns with a focus on the length distribution of continuous ancestry tracts, and the variance in total ancestry proportions among individuals. The models offer improved agreement with Wright-Fisher simulation data when compared to the state-of-the art, and can be used to infer time-dependent migration rates from multiple populations. Considering HapMap African-American (ASW) data, we find that a model with two distinct phases of âEuropeanâ gene flow significantly improves the modeling of both tract lengths and ancestry variances.},

  Abstract                 = {Species pairs that differ primarily in characters involved in mating interactions and are largely sympatric raise intriguing questions about the mode of speciation. When species divergence is relatively recent, the footprint of the demographic history during speciation might be preserved and used to reconstruct the biogeography of species divergence. In this study, patterns of genetic variation were examined throughout the geographical range of two cryptic sister taxa of field crickets, Gryllus texensis and G. rubens; mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) was sequenced in 365 individuals sampled from 48 localities. Despite significant molecular divergence between the species, they were not reciprocally monophyletic. We devised several analyses to statistically explore what historical processes might have given rise to this genealogical structure. The analyses indicated that the biogeographical pattern of genetic variation does not support a model of recent gene flow between species. Instead, coalescent simulations suggested that the genealogical structure within G. texensis, namely a deep split between two geographically overlapping clades, reflects historical substructure within G. texensis. Additional tests that consider the concentration of G. rubens haplotypes in one of the two G. texensis genetic clusters suggest a model of speciation in which G. rubens was derived from one lineage of a geographically subdivided ancestor. These results indicate that, despite the contemporary sympatry of G. texensis and G. rubens, the data are indicative of an peripatric origin in which G. rubens was derived from one of the two historical partitions in the species currently recognized as G. texensis. This proposed model of species divergence suggests how the interplay of geography and selection may give rise to new species, although this requires testing with multilocus data. Specifically, the model highlights how that geographical partitioning of ancestral variation in the past may augment the selectively driven divergence of characters involved in the reproductive isolation of the species today.},

  Abstract                 = {Here, we review the recently burgeoning literature on color polymorphisms, seeking to integrate studies of the maintenance of genetic variation and the evolution of reproductive isolation. Our survey reveals that several mechanisms, some operating between populations and others within them, can contribute to both color polymorphism persistence and speciation. As expected, divergent selection clearly can couple with gene flow to maintain color polymorphism and mediate speciation. More surprisingly, recent evidence suggests that diverse forms of within-population sexual selection can generate negative frequency dependence and initiate reproductive isolation. These findings deserve additional study, particularly concerning the roles of heterogeneous visual environments and correlational selection. Finally, comparative studies and more comprehensive approaches are required to elucidate when color polymorphism evolves, persists, or leads to speciation.},

Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of five present-day humans from different parts of the world identify a number of genomic regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive and skeletal development. We show that Neandertals shared more genetic variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than with present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow from Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.},

  Abstract                 = {De novo DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana is catalyzed by the methyltransferase DRM2, a homolog of the mammalian de novo methyltransferase DNMT3. DRM2 is targeted to DNA by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in a process known as RNA-directed DNA Methylation (RdDM). While several components of the RdDM pathway are known, a functional understanding of the underlying mechanism is far from complete. We employed both forward and reverse genetic approaches to identify factors involved in de novo methylation. We utilized the FWA transgene, which is methylated and silenced when transformed into wild-type plants, but unmethylated and expressed when transformed into de novo methylation mutants. Expression of FWA is marked by a late flowering phenotype, which is easily scored in mutant versus wild-type plants. By reverse genetics we discovered the requirement for known RdDM effectors AGO6 and NRPE5a for efficient de novo methylation. A forward genetic approach uncovered alleles of several components of the RdDM pathway, including alleles of clsy1, ktf1, and nrpd/e2, which have not been previously shown to be required for the initial establishment of DNA methylation. Mutations were mapped and genes cloned by both traditional and whole genome sequencing approaches. The methodologies and the mutant alleles discovered will be instrumental in further studies of de novo DNA methylation.},

This grand division is both unnecessary and counterproductive, and the present review aims to illustrate the numerous links between the patterns and processes found in plants and animals so that a stronger unity can be developed in the future.This review discusses the numerous parallels that exist in genome size evolution between plants and animals, including (i) the construction of large databases, (ii) the patterns of DNA content variation among taxa, (iii) the cytological, morphological, physiological and evolutionary impacts of genome size, (iv) the mechanisms by which genomes change in size, and (v) the development of new methodologies for estimating DNA contents.The fundamental questions of the C-value enigma clearly transcend taxonomic boundaries, and increased communication is therefore urged among those who study genome size evolution, whether in plants, animals or other organisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerous theories have been proposed to account for the pronounced differences in the quantity of non-coding DNA among eukaryotic genomes, but the current repertoire remains incomplete because the only explicit mechanisms it provides involve DNA gain. It has been proposed more recently that biases in spontaneous insertions and deletions (indels) can lead to genome shrinkage by mutational mechanisms alone. The present article provides the first detailed critical discussion of this approach, and covers three different ideas related to it: (1) the general notion of DNA loss by deletion bias, (2) the "DNA loss hypothesis" which supposes that variation in genome size can be attributed to differences in DNA loss rate, and (3) the "mutational equilibrium model" which attempts to describe the long-term evolution of genome size. The mutational equilibrium model is found to be problematic, and it is noted that DNA loss by small indels is too slow in real time to determine variation in genome size above a relatively low threshold. Some alternative explanations for the observed patterns are provided, and the critique also identifies some potential problems with the current dataset. These include a failure to cite a more detailed (and somewhat contradictory) mammalian dataset, a questionable use of arithmetic means with highly skewed data, and important discrepancies among the particular DNA sequences so far analyzed. Overall, evolutionary reductions in genome size are considered important, but the specific mechanism relating to small deletion bias is far too weak to be accepted as a primary determinant of genome size variation in general.},

  Abstract                 = {Haploid genome size (C-value) is correlated positively with cell size, and negatively with cell division rate, in a variety of taxa. Because these associations are causative, genome size has the potential to impact (and in turn, be influenced by) organism-level characters affected by variation in either of these cell-level parameters. One such organismal feature is development. Developmental rate, in particular, has been associated with genome size in numerous plant, vertebrate, and invertebrate groups. However, rate is only one side of the developmental coin; the other important component is complexity. When developmental complexity is held essentially constant, as among many plants, developmental rate is the visibly relevant parameter. In this case, genome size can impose thresholds on developmental lifestyle (and vice versa), as among annual versus perennial plants. When developmental rate is constrained (as during time-limited amphibian metamorphosis), complexity becomes the notable variable. An appreciation for this rate-complexity interaction has so far been lacking, but is essential for an understanding of the relationships between genome size and development. Moreover, such an expanded view may help to explain patterns of variation in taxa as diverse as insects and fish. In each case, a hierarchical approach is necessary which recognizes the complex interaction of evolutionary processes operating at several levels of biological organization.},

  Abstract                 = {Variation in DNA content has been largely ignored as a factor in evolution, particularly following the advent of sequence-based approaches to genomic analysis. The significant genome size diversity among organisms (more than 200000-fold among eukaryotes) bears no relationship to organismal complexity and both the origins and reasons for the clearly non-random distribution of this variation remain unclear. Several theories have been proposed to explain this 'C-value enigma' (heretofore known as the 'C-value paradox'), each of which can be described as either a mutation pressure' or 'optimal DNA' theory. Mutation pressure theories consider the large portion of non-coding DNA in eukaryotic genomes as either 'junk' or 'selfish' DNA and are important primarily in considerations of the origin of secondary DNA. Optimal DNA theories differ from mutation pressure theories by emphasizing the strong link between DNA content and cell and nuclear volumes. While mutation pressure theories generally explain this association with cell size as coincidental, the nucleoskeletal theory proposes a coevolutionary interaction between nuclear and cell volume, with DNA content adjusted adaptively following shifts in cell size. Each of these approaches to the C-value enigma is problematic for a variety of reasons and the preponderance of the available evidence instead favours the nucleotypic theory which postulates a causal link between bulk DNA amount and cell volume. Under this view, variation in DNA content is under direct selection via its impacts on cellular and organismal parameters. Until now, no satisfactory mechanism has been presented to explain this nucleotypic effect. However, recent advances in the study of cell cycle regulation suggest a possible 'gene nucleus interaction model' which may account for it. The present article provides a detailed review of the debate surrounding the C-value enigma, the various theories proposed to explain it, and the evidence in favour of a causal connection between DNA content and cell size. In addition, a new model of nucleotypic influence is developed, along with suggestions for further empirical investigation. Finally, some evolutionary implications of genome size diversity are considered, and a broadening of the traditional 'biological hierarchy' is recommended.},

  Abstract                 = {A study was undertaken to evaluate both a pre-existing method and a newly proposed approach for the estimation of nuclear genome sizes in arthropods. First, concerns regarding the reliability of the well-established method of flow cytometry relating to impacts of rearing conditions on genome size estimates were examined. Contrary to previous reports, a more carefully controlled test found negligible environmental effects on genome size estimates in the fly Drosophila melanogaster. Second, a more recently touted method based on quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was examined in terms of ease of use, efficiency, and (most importantly) accuracy using four test species: the flies Drosophila melanogaster and Musca domestica and the beetles Tribolium castaneum and Dendroctonus ponderosa. The results of this analysis demonstrated that qPCR has the tendency to produce substantially different genome size estimates from other established techniques while also being far less efficient than existing methods.},

  Abstract                 = {The several thousand-fold range in genome size among animals has remained a subject of active research and debate for more than half a century, but no satisfactory explanation has yet been provided. Many one-dimensional models have been postulated, but so far none has been successful in accounting for observed patterns in genome size diversity. The recent model based on differences in effective population size appeared to gain empirical support with a study of genome size and inferred effective population size in fishes, but there were several questionable aspects of the analysis. First, it was based on an assumption that microsatellite heterozygosity indicates long-term effective population size, whereas in actuality these markers evolve quickly and are sensitive to demographic events. Second, it included both ancient polyploids and non-polyploids, the former of which did not gain their current genome sizes through the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations as required in the model. Third, the analysis neglected the tremendous influence that Pleistocene glaciation bottlenecks had on heterozygosities in freshwater (and far less so, marine) fishes. In sum, it is apparent that genomes reached their current sizes in most fishes long before contemporary microsatellite heterozygosities were shaped, and that ancient polyploidy rather than the accumulation of mildly deleterious transposon insertions in small populations is the dominant factor that has influenced the large end of the range of genome sizes among fishes.},

This review summarizes the results of many experiments on the reproductive isolation between yeast species of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group. Hybrids between these species form quite readily in the laboratory, but, if given a choice of species to mate with, some are able to avoid hybridization. F1 hybrids are viable but sterile: the gametes they produce are inviable. For one pair of species, hybrid sterility is probably caused by chromosomal rearrangements, but for all the other species, the major cause of hybrid sterility is antirecombination-the inability of diverged chromosomes to form crossovers during F1 hybrid meiosis. Surprisingly, incompatibility between the genes expressed from different species' genomes is not a major cause of F1 hybrid sterility, although it may contribute to reproductive isolation at other stages of the yeast life cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {Pleiotropy allows for the deterministic fixation of bidirectional mutations: mutations with effects both in the direction of selection and opposite to selection for the same character. Mutations with deleterious effects on some characters can fix because of beneficial effects on other characters. This study analytically quantifies the expected frequency of mutations that fix with negative and positive effects on a character and the average size of a fixed effect on a character when a mutation pleiotropically affects from very few to many characters. The analysis allows for mutational distributions that vary in shape and provides a framework that would allow for varying the frequency at which mutations arise with deleterious and positive effects on characters. The results show that a large fraction of fixed mutations will have deleterious pleiotropic effects even when mutation affects as little as two characters and only directional selection is occurring, and, not surprisingly, as the degree of pleiotropy increases the frequency of fixed deleterious effects increases. As a point of comparison, we show how stabilizing selection and random genetic drift affect the bidirectional distribution of fixed mutational effects. The results are then applied to QTL studies that seek to find loci that contribute to phenotypic differences between populations or species. It is shown that QTL studies are biased against detecting chromosome regions that have deleterious pleiotropic effects on characters.},

  Abstract                 = {Although sexual interactions between species (reproductive interference) have been reported from a wide range of animal taxa, their potential for determining species coexistence is often disregarded. Here, we review evidence from laboratory and field studies illustrating that heterospecific sexual interactions are frequently associated with fitness loss and can have severe ecological and evolutionary consequences. We define reproductive interference as any kind of interspecific interaction during the process of mate acquisition that adversely affects the fitness of at least one of the species involved and that is caused by incomplete species recognition. We distinguish seven types of reproductive interference: signal jamming, heterospecific rivalry, misdirected courtship, heterospecific mating attempts, erroneous female choice, heterospecific mating, and hybridization. We then discuss the sex-specific costs of these types and highlight two typical features of reproductive interference: density-dependence and asymmetry. Similar to competition, reproductive interference can lead to displacement of one species (sexual exclusion), spatial, temporal, or habitat segregation, changes in life history parameters, and reproductive character displacement. In many cases, patterns of coexistence might be shaped by reproductive interference rather than by resource competition, as the presence of a few heterospecifics might substantially decrease reproductive success. Therefore, interspecific sexual interactions should receive more attention in ecological research. Reproductive interference has mainly been discussed in the context of invasive species or hybrid zones, whereas its influence on naturally-occurring sympatric species pairs has rarely been addressed. To improve our knowledge of the ecological significance of reproductive interference, findings from laboratory experiments should be validated in the field. Future studies should also focus on ecological mechanisms, such as temporal spatial, or habitat partitioning, that might enable sexually interacting species to coexist. Reproductive interference also has implications for the management of endangered species, which can be threatened by sexual interactions with invasive or common species. Studies of reproductive interference might even provide new insights for biological pest control.},

<p>Genotype imputation is becoming a popular approach to comparing and combining results of multiple association studies that used different SNP genotyping platforms. The basic idea is to exploit the fact that, due to correlation among untyped and typed SNPs, genotypes of untyped SNPs in each study can be inferred (‚Äúimputed‚Äù) from the genotypes at typed SNPs, often with high accuracy. In this paper, we consider several issues that arise when applying these methods in practice, including factors affecting imputation accuracy, the importance of taking account of imputation uncertainty when testing for association between imputed SNPs and phenotype, how imputation accuracy affects power, and how to combine results across studies when only single-SNP summary data can be shared among research groups.</p>

The pace at which new data and methodologies are generated calls for the use of pre-existing, optimized—yet extensible—code, typically distributed as libraries or packages. This motivated the Bio++ project, aiming at developing a set of C++ libraries for sequence analysis, phylogenetics, population genetics, and molecular evolution. The main attractiveness of Bio++ is the extensibility and reusability of its components through its object-oriented design, without compromising the computer-efficiency of the underlying methods. We present here the second major release of the libraries, which provides an extended set of classes and methods. These extensions notably provide built-in access to sequence databases and new data structures for handling and manipulating sequences from the omics era, such as multiple genome alignments and sequencing reads libraries. More complex models of sequence evolution, such as mixture models and generic n-tuples alphabets, are also included.},

  Abstract                 = {Chromosomal inversions allow genetic divergence of locally adapted populations by reducing recombination between chromosomes with different arrangements. Divergence between populations (or hybridization between species) is expected to leave signatures in the neutral genetic diversity of the inverted region. Quantitative expectations for these patterns, however, have not been obtained. Here, we develop coalescent models of neutral sites linked to an inversion polymorphism in two locally adapted populations. We consider two scenarios of local adaptation: selection on the inversion breakpoints and selection on alleles inside the inversion. We find that ancient inversion polymorphisms cause genetic diversity to depart dramatically from neutral expectations. Other situations, however, lead to patterns that may be difficult to detect; important determinants are the age of the inversion and the rate of gene flux between arrangements. We also study inversions under genetic drift, finding that they produce patterns similar to locally adapted inversions of intermediate age. Our results are consistent with empirical observations, and provide the foundation for quantitative analyses of the roles that inversions have played in speciation.},

It remains difficult, however, to infer introduction routes from molecular data because of a lack of appropriate methods. We evaluate here the use of an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) method for estimating the probabilities of introduction routes of invasive populations based on microsatellite data. We considered the crucial case of a single source population from which two invasive populations originated either serially from a single introduction event or from two independent introduction events. Using simulated datasets, we found that the method gave correct inferences and was robust to many erroneous beliefs. The method was also more efficient than traditional methods based on raw values of statistics such as assignment likelihood or pairwise F(ST). We illustrate some of the features of our ABC method, using real microsatellite datasets obtained for invasive populations of the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera. Most computations were performed with the DIYABC program (http://www1.montpellier.inra.fr/CBGP/diyabc/).},

* The simple and partial Mantel tests are routinely used in many areas of evolutionary biology to assess the significance of the association between two or more matrices of distances relative to the same pairs of individuals or demes. Partial Mantel tests rather than simple Mantel tests are widely used to assess the relationship between two variables displaying some form of structure.

* We show that contrary to a widely shared belief, partial Mantel tests are not valid in this case, and their bias remains close to that of the simple Mantel test.

* We confirm that strong biases are expected under a sampling design and spatial correlation parameter drawn from an actual study.

* The Mantel tests should not be used in case autocorrelation is suspected in both variables compared under the null hypothesis. We outline alternative strategies. The R code used for our computer simulations is distributed as supporting material.

  Abstract                 = {Insertions and deletions (indels) in protein-coding genes are important sources of genetic variation. Their role in creating new proteins may be especially important after gene duplication. However, little is known about how indels affect the divergence of duplicate genes. We here study thousands of duplicate genes in five fish (teleost) species with completely sequenced genomes. The ancestor of these species has been subject to a fish-specific genome duplication (FSGD) event that occurred approximately 350 Ma. We find that duplicate genes contain at least 25% more indels than single-copy genes. These indels accumulated preferentially in the first 40 my after the FSGD. A lack of widespread asymmetric indel accumulation indicates that both members of a duplicate gene pair typically experience relaxed selection. Strikingly, we observe a 30–80% excess of deletions over insertions that is consistent for indels of various lengths and across the five genomes. We also find that indels preferentially accumulate inside loop regions of protein secondary structure and in regions where amino acids are exposed to solvent. We show that duplicate genes with high indel density also show high DNA sequence divergence. Indel density, but not amino acid divergence, can explain a large proportion of the tertiary structure divergence between proteins encoded by duplicate genes. Our observations are consistent across all five fish species. Taken together, they suggest a general pattern of duplicate gene evolution in which indels are important driving forces of evolutionary change.},

  Abstract                 = {Demographic models built from genetic data play important roles in illuminating prehistorical events and serving as null models in genome scans for selection. We introduce an inference method based on the joint frequency spectrum of genetic variants within and between populations. For candidate models we numerically compute the expected spectrum using a diffusion approximation to the one-locus, two-allele Wright-Fisher process, involving up to three simultaneous populations. Our approach is a composite likelihood scheme, since linkage between neutral loci alters the variance but not the expectation of the frequency spectrum. We thus use bootstraps incorporating linkage to estimate uncertainties for parameters and significance values for hypothesis tests. Our method can also incorporate selection on single sites, predicting the joint distribution of selected alleles among populations experiencing a bevy of evolutionary forces, including expansions, contractions, migrations, and admixture. We model human expansion out of Africa and the settlement of the New World, using 5 Mb of noncoding DNA resequenced in 68 individuals from 4 populations (YRI, CHB, CEU, and MXL) by the Environmental Genome Project. We infer divergence between West African and Eurasian populations 140 thousand years ago (95\% confidence interval: 40-270 kya). This is earlier than other genetic studies, in part because we incorporate migration. We estimate the European (CEU) and East Asian (CHB) divergence time to be 23 kya (95\% c.i.: 17-43 kya), long after archeological evidence places modern humans in Europe. Finally, we estimate divergence between East Asians (CHB) and Mexican-Americans (MXL) of 22 kya (95\% c.i.: 16.3-26.9 kya), and our analysis yields no evidence for subsequent migration. Furthermore, combining our demographic model with a previously estimated distribution of selective effects among newly arising amino acid mutations accurately predicts the frequency spectrum of nonsynonymous variants across three continental populations (YRI, CHB, CEU).},

  Abstract                 = {Concerns over fishing impacts on marine populations and ecosystems have intensified the need to improve ocean management. One increasingly popular market-based instrument for ecological stewardship is the use of certification and eco-labeling programs to highlight sustainable fisheries with low environmental impacts. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is the most prominent of these programs. Despite widespread discussions about the rigor of the MSC standards, no comprehensive analysis of the performance of MSC-certified fish stocks has yet been conducted. We compared status and abundance trends of 45 certified stocks with those of 179 uncertified stocks, finding that 74\% of certified fisheries were above biomass levels that would produce maximum sustainable yield, compared with only 44\% of uncertified fisheries. On average, the biomass of certified stocks increased by 46\% over the past 10 years, whereas uncertified fisheries increased by just 9\%. As part of the MSC process, fisheries initially go through a confidential pre-assessment process. When certified fisheries are compared with those that decline to pursue full certification after pre-assessment, certified stocks had much lower mean exploitation rates (67\% of the rate producing maximum sustainable yield vs. 92\% for those declining to pursue certification), allowing for more sustainable harvesting and in many cases biomass rebuilding. From a consumer's point of view this means that MSC-certified seafood is 3-5 times less likely to be subject to harmful fishing than uncertified seafood. Thus, MSC-certification accurately identifies healthy fish stocks and conveys reliable information on stock status to seafood consumers.},

  Abstract                 = {There is growing recognition that mammalian cells produce many thousands of large intergenic transcripts. However, the functional significance of these transcripts has been particularly controversial. Although there are some well-characterized examples, most (>95\%) show little evidence of evolutionary conservation and have been suggested to represent transcriptional noise. Here we report a new approach to identifying large non-coding RNAs using chromatin-state maps to discover discrete transcriptional units intervening known protein-coding loci. Our approach identified approximately 1,600 large multi-exonic RNAs across four mouse cell types. In sharp contrast to previous collections, these large intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) show strong purifying selection in their genomic loci, exonic sequences and promoter regions, with greater than 95\% showing clear evolutionary conservation. We also developed a functional genomics approach that assigns putative functions to each lincRNA, demonstrating a diverse range of roles for lincRNAs in processes from embryonic stem cell pluripotency to cell proliferation. We obtained independent functional validation for the predictions for over 100 lincRNAs, using cell-based assays. In particular, we demonstrate that specific lincRNAs are transcriptionally regulated by key transcription factors in these processes such as p53, NFkappaB, Sox2, Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) and Nanog. Together, these results define a unique collection of functional lincRNAs that are highly conserved and implicated in diverse biological processes.},

  Abstract                 = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20-24 nucleotide RNA molecules that play essential roles in posttranscriptional regulation of target genes. In animals, miRNAs bind to target mRNA through imperfect complementary sequences that are usually located at the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), leading to translational repression or transcript degradation. In plants, miRNAs predominately mediate degradation of target mRNAs via perfect or near-perfect complementary sequences. MicroRNA targets include a large number of transcription factors, suggesting a role of miRNAs in the control of regulatory networks and cellular growth and development. Many miRNAs and their targets are conserved among plants or animals, whereas some are specific to a few plant or animal lineages. Conserved miRNAs do not necessarily exhibit the same expression levels or patterns in different species or at different stages within a species. Therefore, sequence and expression divergence in miRNAs between species may affect miRNA accumulation and target regulation in interspecific hybrids and allopolyploids that contain two or more divergent genomes, leading to developmental changes and phenotypic variation in the new species.},

  Abstract                 = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants are widely used in evolutionary genetics as markers for population history and to estimate divergence times among taxa. Inferences of species history are generally based on phylogenetic comparisons, which assume that molecular evolution is clock-like. Between-species comparisons have also been used to estimate the mutation rate, using sites that are thought to evolve neutrally. We directly estimated the mtDNA mutation rate by scanning the mitochondrial genome of Drosophila melanogaster lines that had undergone approximately 200 generations of spontaneous mutation accumulation (MA). We detected a total of 28 point mutations and eight insertion-deletion (indel) mutations, yielding an estimate for the single-nucleotide mutation rate of 6.2 x 10(-8) per site per fly generation. Most mutations were heteroplasmic within a line, and their frequency distribution suggests that the effective number of mitochondrial genomes transmitted per female per generation is about 30. We observed repeated occurrences of some indel mutations, suggesting that indel mutational hotspots are common. Among the point mutations, there is a large excess of G-->A mutations on the major strand (the sense strand for the majority of mitochondrial genes). These mutations tend to occur at nonsynonymous sites of protein-coding genes, and they are expected to be deleterious, so do not become fixed between species. The overall mtDNA mutation rate per base pair per fly generation in Drosophila is estimated to be about 10x higher than the nuclear mutation rate, but the mitochondrial major strand G-->A mutation rate is about 70x higher than the nuclear rate. Silent sites are substantially more strongly biased towards A and T than nonsynonymous sites, consistent with the extreme mutation bias towards A+T. Strand-asymmetric mutation bias, coupled with selection to maintain specific nonsynonymous bases, therefore provides an explanation for the extreme base composition of the mitochondrial genome of Drosophila.},

  Abstract                 = {Introns comprise a large fraction of eukaryotic genomes, yet little is known about their functional significance. Regulatory elements have been mapped to some introns, though these are believed to account for only a small fraction of genome wide intronic DNA. No consistent patterns have emerged from studies that have investigated general levels of evolutionary constraint in introns.We examine the relationship between intron length and levels of evolutionary constraint by analyzing inter-specific divergence at 225 intron fragments in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, sampled from a broad distribution of intron lengths. We document a strongly negative correlation between intron length and divergence. Interestingly, we also find that divergence in introns is negatively correlated with GC content. This relationship does not account for the correlation between intron length and divergence, however, and may simply reflect local variation in mutational rates or biases.Short introns make up only a small fraction of total intronic DNA in the genome. Our finding that long introns evolve more slowly than average implies that, while the majority of introns in the Drosophila genome may experience little or no selective constraint, most intronic DNA in the genome is likely to be evolving under considerable constraint. Our results suggest that functional elements may be ubiquitous within longer introns and that these introns may have a more general role in regulating gene expression than previously appreciated. Our finding that GC content and divergence are negatively correlated in introns has important implications for the interpretation of the correlation between divergence and levels of codon bias observed in Drosophila.},

  Abstract                 = {Uncertainty about the demographic history of populations can hamper genome-wide scans for selection based on population genetic models. To obtain a portrait of the effects of demographic history on genome variability patterns in Drosophila melanogaster populations, we surveyed noncoding DNA polymorphism at 10 X-linked loci in large samples from three African and two non-African populations. All five populations show significant departures from expectations under the standard neutral model. We detect weak but significant differentiation between East (Kenya and Zimbabwe) and West/Central sub-Saharan (Gabon) African populations. A skew toward high-frequency-derived polymorphisms, elevated levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and significant heterogeneity in levels of polymorphism and divergence in the Gabon sample suggest that this population is further from mutation-drift equilibrium than the two Eastern African populations. Both non-African populations harbor significantly higher levels of LD, a large excess of high-frequency-derived mutations and extreme heterogeneity among loci in levels of polymorphism and divergence. Rejections of the neutral model in D. melanogaster populations using these and similar features have been interpreted as evidence for an important role for natural selection in shaping genome variability patterns. Based on simulations, we conclude that simple bottleneck models are sufficient to account for most, if not all, polymorphism features of both African and non-African populations. In contrast, we show that a steady-state recurrent hitchhiking model fails to account for several aspects of the data. Demographic departures from equilibrium expectations in both ancestral and derived populations thus represent a serious challenge to detecting positive selection in genome-wide scans using current methodologies.},

(GLMM). Special emphasis is placed on understanding the underlying struc-
ture of a GLMM in order to show that slight modications of this structure can
produce a wide range of models. These include familiar models like regression
and ANOVA, but also models with intimidating names: animal models, thresh-
old models, meta-analysis, MANCOVA and random regression . . . The primary
aim of the course is to show that these models are only daunting by name.
The secondary aim is to show how these models can be fitted in a Bayesian
framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in the R pack-
age MCMCglmm. For those not comfortable using Bayesian methods, many of the
models outlined in the course notes can be tted in as reml or lmer with little
extra work. If you do use MCMCglmm, please, cite Hadfield (2010).},

In all but a few cases, the method of parentage assignment is divorced from the methods used to estimate the parameters of primary interest, such as mate choice or heritability. Here we present a Bayesian approach that simultaneously estimates the parentage of a sample of individuals and a wide range of population-level parameters in which we are interested. We show that joint estimation of parentage and population-level parameters increases the power of parentage assignment, reduces bias in parameter estimation, and accurately evaluates uncertainty in both. We illustrate the method by analysing a number of simulated test data sets, and through a re-analysis of parentage in the Seychelles warbler, Acrocephalus sechellensis. A combination of behavioural, spatial and genetic data are used in the analyses and, importantly, the method does not require strong prior information about the relationship between nongenetic data and parentage.},

  Abstract                 = {Mitochondria are descended from free-living bacteria that were engulfed by another cell between one and a half to two billion years ago. A redistribution of DNA led to most genetic information being lost or transferred to a large central genome in the nucleus, leaving a residual genome in each mitochondrion. Oxidative phosphorylation, the most critical function of mitochondria, depends on the functional compatibility of proteins encoded by both the nucleus and mitochondria. We investigate whether selection for adaptation between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (mitonuclear co-adaptation) could, in principle, have promoted uniparental inheritance of mitochondria and thereby the evolution of two mating types or sexes. Using a mathematical model, we explore the importance of the radical differences in ploidy levels, sexual and asexual modes of inheritance, and mutation rates of the nucleus and mitochondria. We show that the major features of mitochondrial inheritance, notably uniparental inheritance and bottlenecking, enhance the co-adaptation of mitochondrial and nuclear genes and therefore improve fitness. We conclude that, under a wide range of conditions, selection for mitonuclear co-adaptation favours the evolution of two distinct mating types or sexes in sexual species.},

I address the challenges present in studying natural selection without the familiar structure and regularity of protein-coding sequences, but show that most tests of neutrality that have been used for coding regions are applicable to non-coding regions, albeit with some caveats. While some experimental investment is necessary to identify heritable regulatory variation, the most basic inferences about selection require very little functional information. A growing body of research on cis-regulatory variation has uncovered all the forms of selection common to coding regions, in addition to novel forms of selection. An emerging pattern seems to be the ubiquity of local adaptation and balancing selection, possibly due to the greater freedom organisms have to fine-tune gene expression without changing protein function. It is clear from multiple single locus and whole genome studies of non-coding regulatory DNA that the effects of natural selection reach far beyond the start and stop codons.},

  Abstract                 = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a highly flexible technique that allows the estimation of parameters under demographic models that are too complex to be handled by full-likelihood methods. We assess the utility of this method to estimate the parameters of range expansion in a two-dimensional stepping-stone model, using samples from either a single deme or multiple demes. A minor modification to the ABC procedure is introduced, which leads to an improvement in the accuracy of estimation. The method is then used to estimate the expansion time and migration rates for five natural common vole populations in Switzerland typed for a sex-linked marker and a nuclear marker. Estimates based on both markers suggest that expansion occurred <10,000 years ago, after the most recent glaciation, and that migration rates are strongly male biased.},

  Abstract                 = {The distribution of allele frequencies across polymorphic sites, also known as the site frequency spectrum (SFS), is of primary interest in population genetics. It is a complete summary of sequence variation at unlinked sites and more generally, its shape reflects underlying population genetic processes. One practical challenge is that inferring the SFS from low coverage sequencing data in a straightforward manner by using genotype calls can lead to significant bias. To reduce bias, previous studies have used a statistical method that directly estimates the SFS from sequencing data by first computing site allele frequency (SAF) likelihood for each site (i.e. the likelihood a site has each possible allele frequency conditional on observed sequence reads) using a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. Although this method produces an accurate SFS, computing the SAF likelihood is quadratic in the number of samples sequenced.To overcome this computational challenge, we propose an algorithm, 'score-limited DP' algorithm, which is linear in the number of genomes to compute the SAF likelihood. This algorithm works because in a lower triangular matrix that arises in the DP algorithm, all non-negligible values of the SAF likelihood are concentrated on a few cells around the best-guess allele counts. We show that our score-limited DP algorithm has comparable accuracy but is faster than the original DP algorithm. This speed improvement makes SFS estimation practical when using low coverage NGS data from a large number of individuals.The program will be available via a link from the Novembre lab website (http://jnpopgen.org/).},

  Abstract                 = {The site frequency spectrum (SFS) is of primary interest in population genetic studies, because the SFS compresses variation data into a simple summary from which many population genetic inferences can proceed. However, inferring the SFS from sequencing data is challenging because genotype calls from sequencing data are often inaccurate due to high error rates and if not accounted for, this genotype uncertainty can lead to serious bias in downstream analysis based on the inferred SFS. Here, we compare two approaches to estimate the SFS from sequencing data: one approach infers individual genotypes from aligned sequencing reads and then estimates the SFS based on the inferred genotypes (call-based approach) and the other approach directly estimates the SFS from aligned sequencing reads by maximum likelihood (direct estimation approach). We find that the SFS estimated by the direct estimation approach is unbiased even at low coverage, whereas the SFS by the call-based approach becomes biased as coverage decreases. The direction of the bias in the call-based approach depends on the pipeline to infer genotypes. Estimating genotypes by pooling individuals in a sample (multisample calling) results in underestimation of the number of rare variants, whereas estimating genotypes in each individual and merging them later (single-sample calling) leads to overestimation of rare variants. We characterize the impact of these biases on downstream analyses, such as demographic parameter estimation and genome-wide selection scans. Our work highlights that depending on the pipeline used to infer the SFS, one can reach different conclusions in population genetic inference with the same data set. Thus, careful attention to the analysis pipeline and SFS estimation procedures is vital for population genetic inferences.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is emerging as an efficient and cost-effective tool in population genomic analyses of nonmodel organisms, allowing simultaneous resequencing of many regions of multi-genomic DNA from multiplexed samples. Here, we detail our synthesis of protocols for targeted resequencing of mitochondrial and nuclear loci by generating indexed genomic libraries for multiplexing up to 100 individuals in a single sequencing pool, and then enriching the pooled library using custom DNA capture arrays. Our use of DNA sequence from one species to capture and enrich the sequencing libraries of another species (i.e. cross-species DNA capture) indicates that efficient enrichment occurs when sequences are up to about 12\% divergent, allowing us to take advantage of genomic information in one species to sequence orthologous regions in related species. In addition to a complete mitochondrial genome on each array, we have included between 43 and 118 nuclear loci for low-coverage sequencing of between 18 kb and 87 kb of DNA sequence per individual for single nucleotide polymorphisms discovery from 50 to 100 individuals in a single sequencing lane. Using this method, we have generated a total of over 500 whole mitochondrial genomes from seven cetacean species and green sea turtles. The greater variation detected in mitogenomes relative to short mtDNA sequences is helping to resolve genetic structure ranging from geographic to species-level differences. These NGS and analysis techniques have allowed for simultaneous population genomic studies of mtDNA and nDNA with greater genomic coverage and phylogeographic resolution than has previously been possible in marine mammals and turtles.},

We confirm previous results that only directional epistasis, in which genes on average reinforce or diminish each other's effects, contribute to the initial evolution of mutational effects. Thus, either canalization or decanalization can occur under directional selection, depending on whether positive or negative epistasis is prevalent. We then focus on the evolution of the epistatic coefficients themselves. In the absence of higher-order epistasis, positive pairwise epistasis will tend to weaken relative to additive effects, while negative pairwise epistasis will tend to become strengthened. Positive third-order epistasis will counteract these effects, while negative third-order epistasis will reinforce them. More generally, gene interactions of all orders have an inherent tendency for negative changes under directional selection, which can only be modified by higher-order directional epistasis. We identify three types of nonadditive quasi-equilibrium architectures that, although not strictly stable, can be maintained for an extended time: (1) nondirectional epistatic architectures; (2) canalized architectures with strong epistasis; and (3) near-additive architectures in which additive effects keep increasing relative to epistasis.},

  Abstract                 = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms are currently being utilized for targeted sequencing of candidate genes or genomic intervals to perform sequence-based association studies. To evaluate these platforms for this application, we analyzed human sequence generated by the Roche 454, Illumina GA, and the ABI SOLiD technologies for the same 260 kb in four individuals.Local sequence characteristics contribute to systematic variability in sequence coverage (>100-fold difference in per-base coverage), resulting in patterns for each NGS technology that are highly correlated between samples. A comparison of the base calls to 88 kb of overlapping ABI 3730xL Sanger sequence generated for the same samples showed that the NGS platforms all have high sensitivity, identifying >95\% of variant sites. At high coverage, depth base calling errors are systematic, resulting from local sequence contexts; as the coverage is lowered additional 'random sampling' errors in base calling occur.Our study provides important insights into systematic biases and data variability that need to be considered when utilizing NGS platforms for population targeted sequencing studies.},

In this study I apply a multilocus test statistic to >10,000 SNP markers assayed in wild-derived inbred strains of house mice to identify genomic regions of elevated differentiation between two subspecies of house mice, Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus. Differentiation was high through approximately 90\% of the X chromosome. In addition, eight regions of high differentiation were identified on the autosomes, totaling 7.5\% of the autosomal genome. Regions of high differentiation were confirmed by direct sequencing of samples collected from the wild. Some regions of elevated differentiation have an overrepresentation of genes with host-pathogen interactions and olfaction. The most strongly differentiated region on the X has previously been shown to fail to introgress across a hybrid zone between the two subspecies. This survey indicates autosomal regions that should also be examined for differential introgression across the hybrid zone, as containing potential genes causing hybrid unfitness.},

These tract lengths contain information about the amount of genetic diversity that existed at various times in the history of a species and can therefore be used to estimate past population sizes. IBS tracts shared between DNA sequences from different populations also contain information about population divergence and past gene flow. By looking at IBS tracts shared within Africans and Europeans, as well as between the two groups, we infer that the two groups diverged in a complex way over more than 40,000 years, exchanging DNA as recently as 12,000 years ago. Besides having anthropological importance, the history we infer predicts the distribution of pairwise differences between humans extremely accurately at a fine-scale level, which may aid future scans for natural selection in the genome. Despite our current focus on human data, the method is general enough to use on other organisms and has the potential to shed light on the demography of many more species.},

  Abstract                 = {Hybrid zones have been promoted as windows on the evolutionary process and as laboratories for studying divergence and speciation. Patterns of divergence between hybridizing species can now be characterized on a genomewide scale, and recent genome scans have focused on the presence of ‚Äòislands‚Äô of divergence. Patterns of heterogeneous genomic divergence may reflect differential introgression following secondary contact and provide insights into which genome regions contribute to local adaptation, hybrid unfitness and positive assortative mating. However, heterogeneous genome divergence can also arise in the absence of any gene flow, as a result of variation in selection and recombination across the genome. We suggest that to understand hybrid zone origins and dynamics, it is essential to distinguish between genome regions that are divergent between pure parental populations and regions that show restricted introgression where these populations interact in hybrid zones. The latter, more so than the former, reveal the likely genetic architecture of reproductive isolation. Mosaic hybrid zones, because of their complex structure and multiple contacts, are particularly good subjects for distinguishing primary intergradation from secondary contact. Comparisons among independent hybrid zones or transects that involve the ‚Äòsame‚Äô species pair can also help to distinguish between divergence with gene flow and secondary contact. However, data from replicate hybrid zones or replicate transects do not reveal consistent patterns; in a few cases, patterns of introgression are similar across independent transects, but for many taxa, there is distinct lack of concordance, presumably due to variation in environmental context and/or variation in the genetics of the interacting populations.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of next-generation sequencing instruments has led to the generation of millions of short sequences in a single run. The process of aligning these reads to a reference genome is time consuming and demands the development of fast and accurate alignment tools. However, the current proposed tools make different compromises between the accuracy and the speed of mapping. Moreover, many important aspects are overlooked while comparing the performance of a newly developed tool to the state of the art. Therefore, there is a need for an objective evaluation method that covers all the aspects. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking suite to extensively analyze sequencing tools with respect to various aspects and provide an objective comparison.We applied our benchmarking tests on 9 well known mapping tools, namely, Bowtie, Bowtie2, BWA, SOAP2, MAQ, RMAP, GSNAP, Novoalign, and mrsFAST (mrFAST) using synthetic data and real RNA-Seq data. MAQ and RMAP are based on building hash tables for the reads, whereas the remaining tools are based on indexing the reference genome. The benchmarking tests reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each tool. The results show that no single tool outperforms all others in all metrics. However, Bowtie maintained the best throughput for most of the tests while BWA performed better for longer read lengths. The benchmarking tests are not restricted to the mentioned tools and can be further applied to others.The mapping process is still a hard problem that is affected by many factors. In this work, we provided a benchmarking suite that reveals and evaluates the different factors affecting the mapping process. Still, there is no tool that outperforms all of the others in all the tests. Therefore, the end user should clearly specify his needs in order to choose the tool that provides the best results.},

However, discarded fish are food for a range of scavenging species; so, ending discarding may have ecological consequences. Here we investigate the sensitivity of ecological effects to discarding policies using an ecosystem model of the North Seaâa region where 30â40% of trawled fish catch is currently discarded. We show that landing the entire catch while fishing as usual has conservation penalties for seabirds, marine mammals and seabed fauna, and no benefit to fish stocks. However, combining landing obligations with changes in fishing practices to limit the capture of unwanted fish results in trophic cascades that can benefit birds, mammals and most fish stocks. Our results highlight the importance of considering the broader ecosystem consequences of fishery management policy, since species interactions may dissipate or negate intended benefits.},

  Abstract                 = {Following the repeal in 1962 of a long-standing ban on trawling, yields of demersal fish from the Firth of Clyde, southwest Scotland, increased to a maximum in 1973 and then declined until the directed fishery effectively ceased in the early 2000s. Since then, the only landings of demersal fish from the Firth have been by-catch in the Norway lobster fishery. We analysed changes in biomass density, species diversity and length structure of the demersal fish community between 1927 and 2009 from scientific trawl surveys, and related these to the fishery harvesting rate. As yields collapsed, the community transformed from a state in which biomass was distributed across numerous species (high species evenness) and large maximum length taxa were common, to one in which 90 per cent of the biomass was vested in one species (whiting), and both large individuals and large maximum length species were rare. Species evenness recovered quickly once the directed fishery ceased, but 10 years later, the community was still deficient in large individuals.

  Abstract                 = {Over the next few years, the efficient use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in human genetics research will depend heavily upon the effective mechanisms for the selective enrichment of genomic regions of interest. Recently, comprehensive exome capture arrays have become available for targeting approximately 33 Mb or approximately 180,000 coding exons across the human genome. Selective genomic enrichment of the human exome offers an attractive option for new experimental designs aiming to quickly identify potential disease-associated genetic variants, especially in family-based studies. We have evaluated a 2.1 M feature human exome capture array on eight individuals from a three-generation family pedigree. We were able to cover up to 98\% of the targeted bases at a long-read sequence read depth of > or = 3, 86\% at a read depth of > or = 10, and over 50\% of all targets were covered with > or = 20 reads. We identified up to 14,284 SNPs and small indels per individual exome, with up to 1,679 of these representing putative novel polymorphisms. Applying the conservative genotype calling approach HCDiff, the average rate of detection of a variant allele based on Illumina 1 M BeadChips genotypes was 95.2\% at > or = 10x sequence. Further, we propose an advantageous genotype calling strategy for low covered targets that empirically determines cut-off thresholds at a given coverage depth based on existing genotype data. Application of this method was able to detect >99\% of SNPs covered > or = 8x. Our results offer guidance for "real-world" applications in human genetics and provide further evidence that microarray-based exome capture is an efficient and reliable method to enrich for chromosomal regions of interest in next-generation sequencing experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {Interpretation of genetic differentiation values is often problematic because of their dependence on the level of genetic variation. For example, the maximum level of GST is less than the average within population homozygosity so that for highly variable loci, even when no alleles are shared between subpopulations, GST may be low. To remedy this difficulty, a standardized measure of genetic differentiation is introduced here, one which has the same range, 0-1, for all levels of genetic variation. With this measure, the magnitude is the proportion of the maximum differentiation possible for the level of subpopulation homozygosity observed. This is particularly important for situations in which the mutation rate is of the same magnitude or higher than the rate of gene flow. The standardized measure allows comparison between loci with different levels of genetic variation, such as allozymes and microsatellite loci, or mtDNA and Y-chromosome genes, and for genetic differentiation for organisms with different effective population sizes.},

  Abstract                 = {An opto-electronic system has been developed to measure movements of insect appendages. It is made from a mirror-lens and a linear position-sensitive photodiode. The design of the mirror-lens has been exploited to axially mount a high intensity halogen light source in front of the mirror-lens. The system monitors a reflective marker which is attached to the moving object. Upon illumination by the light source the reflected light is picked up by the optical system and is focussed on the diode. The diode provides a voltage output proportional to the distribution of the light on it's surface. Since the marker is the brightest spot in the image the output of the system corresponds to the position of the marker. At a working distance of 80 cm appendage movements with amplitudes from 10 [mu]m to 20 mm peak-peak amplitude can be recorded. The system accurately detects movements ranging from slow positional changes to 5 kHz oscillations. Currently it used to measure the stridulatory wing movements of crickets but may be applied to a variety of movement recordings.},

Here, we demonstrate that a deeper understanding of the distribution of the variant call frequencies at heterozygous loci in NGS data sets is a prerequisite for sensitive variant detection. We model the crucial steps in an NGS protocol as a stochastic branching process and derive a mathematical framework for the expected distribution of alleles at heterozygous loci before measurement that is sequencing. We confirm our theoretical results by analyzing technical replicates of human exome data and demonstrate that the variance of allele frequencies at heterozygous loci is higher than expected by a simple binomial distribution. Due to this high variance, mutation callers relying on binomial distributed priors are less sensitive for heterozygous variants that deviate strongly from the expected mean frequency. Our results also indicate that error rates can be reduced to a greater degree by technical replicates than by increasing sequencing depth.},

The estimated proportion of F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrids in the reproductive population was significantly lower than expected under a closed population model, indicating strong selection against hybrids. Genetic typing of 101 individuals at four microsatellite loci also showed significant population differentiation, but nuclear gene flow was estimated to be 75 times higher than mitochondrial gene flow. This strong discrepancy is probably due to unisexual hybrid sterility (Haldane's rule). Thus, there is a strong, but incomplete, reproductive barrier between these taxa.},

  Abstract                 = {Until recently, it has been common practice for a phylogenetic analysis to use a single gene sequence from a single individual organism as a proxy for an entire species. With technological advances, it is now becoming more common to collect data sets containing multiple gene loci and multiple individuals per species. These data sets often reveal the need to directly model intraspecies polymorphism and incomplete lineage sorting in phylogenetic estimation procedures. For a single species, coalescent theory is widely used in contemporary population genetics to model intraspecific gene trees. Here, we present a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method for the multispecies coalescent. Our method coestimates multiple gene trees embedded in a shared species tree along with the effective population size of both extant and ancestral species. The inference is made possible by multilocus data from multiple individuals per species. Using a multiindividual data set and a series of simulations of rapid species radiations, we demonstrate the efficacy of our new method. These simulations give some insight into the behavior of the method as a function of sampled individuals, sampled loci, and sequence length. Finally, we compare our new method to both an existing method (BEST 2.2) with similar goals and the supermatrix (concatenation) method. We demonstrate that both BEST and our method have much better estimation accuracy for species tree topology than concatenation, and our method outperforms BEST in divergence time and population size estimation.},

The method takes into account the special nature of these data: random sampling of genomic segments from one or more individuals and a relatively high error rate for individual reads. Applying this method to data from the Celera human genome sequencing and SNP discovery project, we obtain estimates of nucleotide diversity in windows spanning the human genome and show that the diversity to divergence ratio is reduced in regions of low recombination. Furthermore, we show that the elevated diversity in telomeric regions is mainly due to elevated mutation rates and not due to decreased levels of background selection. However, we find indications that telomeres as well as centromeres experience greater impact from natural selection than intrachromosomal regions. Finally, we identify a number of genomic regions with increased or reduced diversity compared with the local level of human-chimpanzee divergence and the local recombination rate.},

During training a saturation level of about 85â90% correct choices or more can be reached within 50â100 visits. To investigate generalization abilities, the bats were tested with pairs of the same shape but of different size. Although no reward was offered, they preferred the hollow sphere (30Â mm and 50Â mm diameter, but not 18Â mm) over the corresponding paraboloids. Thus, the bats were able to generalize some features of the rewarded form and detect them in forms of the same shape but different size. This transposition is remarkable, since the bats could not use absolute spectral characters, but had to pay attention to size-independent features common to hollow hemispheres. Possible cues are the variation of echoes in dependence of different angles of calling direction (constant in spheres, changing with position in paraboloids) and/or the âtimbreâ of the echoes, i.e. their spectral pattern independent of their absolute pitch},

Myotis alcathoe n. sp. is the smallest species among the European whiskered bats and uses the highest-frequency echolocation calls of all the European Myotis species. It prefers to hunt in small valleys with deciduous trees and flowing water, which is an endangered habitat. Records from Greece and Hungary indicate a distribution range in south-eastern Europe.},

  Abstract                 = {Speciation can be viewed as a continuum, potentially divisible into several states: (1) continuous variation within panmictic populations, (2) partially discontinuous variation with minor reproductive isolation, (3) strongly discontinuous variation with strong but reversible reproductive isolation and (4) complete and irreversible reproductive isolation. Research on sticklebacks (Gasterosteidae) reveals factors that influence progress back and forth along this continuum, as well as transitions between the states. Most populations exist in state 1, even though some of these show evidence of disruptive selection and positive assortative mating. Transitions to state 2 seem to usually involve strong divergent selection coupled with at least a bit of geographic separation, such as parapatry (e.g. lake and stream pairs and mud and lava pairs) or allopatry (e.g. different lakes). Transitions to state 3 can occur when allopatric or parapatric populations that evolved under strong divergent selection come into secondary contact (most obviously the sympatric benthic and limnetic pairs), but might also occur between populations that remained in parapatry or allopatry. Transitions to state 4 might be decoupled from these selective processes, because the known situations of complete, or nearly complete, reproductive isolation (Japan Sea and Pacific Ocean pair and the recognized gasterosteid species) are always associated with chromosomal rearrangements and environment-independent genetic incompatibilities. Research on sticklebacks has thus revealed complex and shifting interactions between selection, adaptation, mutation and geography during the course of speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {Speciation often involves incremental responses to natural selection and results in large scale genomic changes, but it may also occur abruptly and with little genetic imprint, as seen in some complexes of cryptic species. Recent attention has focused on sexual selection in rapid speciation, because it can disrupt premating signals that mediate reproductive isolation. Some models require that environmental adaptation assist sexual selection during speciation, while others show that populations can diverge through mate choice alone. We propose that speciation involving environmental adaptation in premating signals is likely to have a polygenic basis, while speciation due to arbitrary changes in premating signals could be accompanied by changes at just a few loci. The sibling species Chrysoperla plorabunda and Chrysoperla johnsoni belong to a large complex of cryptic species of green lacewings, and meet all criteria for speciation via sexual selection. We perform a genetic analysis of line crosses between them, focusing on their substrate-borne premating songs. Measurements of seven song features and their principal components are compared among parentals, F1 and F2 hybrids, and backcrosses. The distributions of phenotypes are consistent with a model of more than one, but not many, genes. Sex linkage and/or maternal effects are negligible. C. plorabunda is dominant for most traits affecting mate choice. Bayesian analyses of segregation variance show significant additive and epistatic effects on line means. A Bayesian Castle-Wright estimate suggests that relatively few effective factors are responsible for variation in volley period (x = two factors), number of volleys per song (x = 1), and PC-1 (x = 4). Our results are consistent with simple genetic architecture of songs, supporting a role for major genes in premating isolation and strengthening the notion that mate choice alone, without significant environmental adaptation, has been responsible for generating new lacewing species.},

Infection was found only in the fat body, and developing viruses and inclusion bodies were observed in the nuclei and cytoplasm of infected cells. Although the size of the inclusion bodies in cells varied at different stages of infection, the inclusion bodies appeared to grow during the infection. Electron microscopic investigations of viral replication showed that at about 8 days after inoculation presumptive viral particles had developed as buds or protrusions from precursor granular masses; thereafter, these particles underwent internal differentiation and were incorporated into developing inclusion bodies. The GIBV was similar to insect viruses in the genus Vagoiavirus Weiser and to pox viruses, particularly vaccinia.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the effects of epistasis in a polygenic trait in the balance of mutation and stabilizing selection. The main issues are the genetic variation maintained in equilibrium and the evolution of the mutational effect distribution. The model assumes symmetric mutation and a continuum of alleles at all loci. Epistasis is modeled proportional to pairwise products of the single-locus effects. A general analytical formalism is developed. Assuming linkage equilibrium, we derive results for the equilibrium mutation load and the genetic and mutational variance in the house of cards and the Gaussian approximation. The additive genetic variation maintained in mutation-selection balance is reduced by any pattern of the epistatic interactions. The mutational variance, in contrast, is often increased. Large differences in mutational effects among loci emerge, and a negative correlation among (standard mean) locus mutation effects and mutation rates is predicted. Contrary to the common view since Waddington, we find that stabilizing selection in general does not lead to canalization of the trait. We propose that canalization as a target of selection instead occurs at the genic level. Here, primarily genes with a high mutation rate are buffered, often at the cost of decanalization of other genes. An intuitive interpretation of this view is given in the discussion.},

They used quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapping analysis of 70 skeletal characters in mice and regressed the total QTL effect on the number of traits affected (level of pleiotropy). From their results they suggest that mutations with higher pleiotropy have a larger effect, on average, on each of the affected traits-a surprising finding that contradicts previous models. We argue that the possibility of some QTL regions containing multiple mutations, which was not considered by the authors, introduces a bias that can explain the discrepancy between one of the previously suggested models and the new data.},

We use diffusion theory to calculate the probabilities for selective adaptations and find a large increase in the fixation probability for weak substitutions, if alleles originate from the standing genetic variation. We then determine the parameter regions where each scenario-standing variation vs. new mutations-is more likely. Adaptations from the standing genetic variation are favored if either the selective advantage is weak or the selection coefficient and the mutation rate are both high. Finally, we analyze the probability of "soft sweeps," where multiple copies of the selected allele contribute to a substitution, and discuss the consequences for the footprint of selection on linked neutral variation. We find that soft sweeps with weaker selective footprints are likely under both scenarios if the mutation rate and/or the selection coefficient is high.},

  Abstract                 = {Genome-wide molecular markers are often being used to evaluate genetic diversity in germplasm collections and for making genomic selections in breeding programs. To accurately predict phenotypes and assay genetic diversity, molecular markers should assay a representative sample of the polymorphisms in the population under study. Ascertainment bias arises when marker data is not obtained from a random sample of the polymorphisms in the population of interest. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is rapidly emerging as a low-cost genotyping platform, even for the large, complex, and polyploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genome. With GBS, marker discovery and genotyping occur simultaneously, resulting in minimal ascertainment bias. The previous platform of choice for whole-genome genotyping in many species such as wheat was DArT (Diversity Array Technology) and has formed the basis of most of our knowledge about cereals genetic diversity. This study compared GBS and DArT marker platforms for measuring genetic diversity and genomic selection (GS) accuracy in elite U.S. soft winter wheat. From a set of 365 breeding lines, 38,412 single nucleotide polymorphism GBS markers were discovered and genotyped. The GBS SNPs gave a higher GS accuracy than 1,544 DArT markers on the same lines, despite 43.9\% missing data. Using a bootstrap approach, we observed significantly more clustering of markers and ascertainment bias with DArT relative to GBS. The minor allele frequency distribution of GBS markers had a deficit of rare variants compared to DArT markers. Despite the ascertainment bias of the DArT markers, GS accuracy for three traits out of four was not significantly different when an equal number of markers were used for each platform. This suggests that the gain in accuracy observed using GBS compared to DArT markers was mainly due to a large increase in the number of markers available for the analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Global climate has fluctuated greatly during the past three million years, leading to the recent major ice ages. An inescapable consequence for most living organisms is great changes in their distribution, which are expressed differently in boreal, temperate and tropical zones. Such range changes can be expected to have genetic consequences, and the advent of DNA technology provides most suitable markers to examine these. Several good data sets are now available, which provide tests of expectations, insights into species colonization and unexpected genetic subdivision and mixture of species. The genetic structure of human populations may be viewed in the same context. The present genetic structure of populations, species and communities has been mainly formed by Quaternary ice ages, and genetic, fossil and physical data combined can greatly help our understanding of how organisms were so affected.},

The fossil record shows that these ice ages and their nested millennial oscillations caused substantial changes in species distributions and with genetic evidence allows deduction of refugia and colonization routes in arctic, temperate, desert and tropical regions. The age of divergence between hybridizing lineages varies from the Late Pleistocene to the Late Miocene, implying much range change and varying selection on sister lineages. Hybridizing lineages in the Tropical and Temperate regions range in age from young to old, but those studied in the Arctic are no more than a few ice ages old and their refugial roots are not clear. Mid to low latitude regions often show parapatric patchworks of lineages and multiple refugia stable through many climatic oscillations. Particular hybrid zones may have formed more than once; while some expansions were not the same, producing reticulation and introgression in previous glacial cycles. Hybrid-zone roots are complex and deep, and considerations of their complexity can reveal evolutionary pathways of species. They are indeed windows on evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Population structure is the result of both present processes and past history. Molecular markers are proving of great value in describing the former, and it is important to similarly determine the latter in order to understand their respective contributions. The study of palaeo-climates has also advanced significantly, and in particular that of the Pleistocene ice ages, which modified species ranges considerably. The last ice age and rapid post-glacial colonization of Europe is summarized. Possible population genetic consequences of expansion northward from southern refugia, and those of remaining in these mountainous regions are discussed. A series of recent case studies are detailed where DNA sequence information has been used to describe species genetic variation and subdivision across Europe. These include a grasshopper, the hedgehog, oak trees, the common beech, the black alder, the brown bear, newts, shrews, water vole, silver fir and house mice. These molecular data confirm southern peninsulas of Europe as major ice age refugia, and in most cases demonstrate that genetically distinct taxa emerged from them. They can thus define genomic differences and so greatly augment previous fossil data. The refugial genomes contributed differently in various species to the re-colonization of Europe, with three broad patterns described as paradigms--«grasshopper», «hedgehog» and «bear». These different expansion patterns produced clusters of hybrid zones where they made contact, and it is argued that many species genomes may be further cryptically subdivided. A reduction in diversity from southern to northern Europe in the extent of allelic variation and species subdivision is seen; this is attributed to rapid expansion northward and the varied topography of southern refugia allowing populations to diverge through several ice ages. The differences in DNA sequence indicate that some species have been diverging in refugial regions for a few ice ages at most, whilst distinct lineages in other species suggest much more ancient separation. },

  Abstract                 = {The genetic effects of pleistocene ice ages are approached by deduction from paleoenvironmental information, by induction from the genetic structure of populations and species, and by their combination to infer likely consequences. (1) Recent palaeoclimatic information indicate rapid global reversals and changes in ranges of species which would involve elimination with spreading from the edge. Leading edge colonization during a rapid expansion would be leptokurtic and lead to homozygosity and spatial assortment of genomes. In Europe and North America, ice age contractions were into southern refugia, which would promote genome reorganization. (2) The present day genetic structure of species shows frequent geographic subdivision, with parapatric genomes, hybrid zones and suture zones. A survey of recent \{DNA\} phylogeographic information supports and extends earlier work. (3) The grasshopperChorthippus parallelusis used to illustrate such data and processes. Its range in Europe is divided on \{DNA\} sequences into five parapatric races, with southern genomes showing greater haplotype diversity ‚Äî probably due to southern mountain blocks acting as refugia and northern expansion reducing diversity. (4) Comparison with other recent studies shows a concordance of such phylogeographic data over pleistocene time scales. (5) The role that ice age range changes may have played in changing adaptations is explored, including the limits of range, rapid change in new invasions and refugial differentiation in a variety of organisms. (6) The effects of these events in causing divergence and speciation are explored usingChorthippusas a paradigm. Repeated contraction and expansion would accumulate genome differences and adaptations, protected from mixing by hybrid zones, and such a composite mode of speciation could apply to many organisms. },

We argue that biologists who endure the species problem can benefit from a synthesis in which individual taxonomic species are used as hypotheses of evolutionary entities. We discuss two sources of species uncertainty: one that is a semantic confusion, and a second that is caused by the inherent uncertainty of evolutionary entities. The former can be dispelled with careful communication, whereas the latter is a conventional scientific uncertainty that can only be mitigated by research. This scientific uncertainty cannot be [`]solved' or stamped out, but neither need it be ignored or feared.},

  Abstract                 = {Comparative phylogeographic studies often reveal disparate levels of sequence divergence between lineages spanning a common geographic barrier, leading to the conclusion that isolation was nonsynchronous. However, only rarely do researchers account for the expected variance associated with ancestral coalescence and among-taxon variation in demographic history. We introduce a flexible approximate Bayesian computational (ABC) framework that can test for simultaneous divergence (TSD) using a hierarchical model that incorporates idiosyncratic differences in demographic history across taxon pairs. The method is tested across a range of conditions and is shown to be accurate even with single-locus mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data. We apply this method to a landmark dataset of putative simultaneous vicariance, eight geminate echinoid taxon pairs thought to have been split by the Isthmus of Panama 3.1 million years ago. The ABC posterior estimates are not consistent with a history of simultaneous vicariance given these data. Subsequent ABC estimates under a constrained model that assumes two divergence times across the eight taxon pairs suggests simultaneous divergence 3.1 million years ago in seven of the taxon pairs and a more recent divergence in the remaining taxon pair. These ABC estimates on the simultaneous divergence of the seven taxon pairs correspond to a DNA substitution rate of approximately 1.59% per lineage per million years at the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase I gene. This ABC framework can easily be modified to analyze single taxon-pair datasets and/or be expanded to include multiple loci, migration, recombination, and other idiosyncratic demographic histories. The flexible aspect of ABC and its built-in evaluation of estimator bias and statistical power has the potential to greatly enhance statistical rigor in phylogeographic studies.

Over the past five decades, limited glimpses into the relationship between gene sequence and function have sparked a long debate regarding the distribution, relative proportion, and evolutionary significance of deleterious, neutral, and advantageous mutations. Our systematic experimental measurement of fitness effects of Hsp90 mutants in yeast, evaluated in the light of existing population genetic theory, are remarkably consistent with a nearly neutral model of molecular evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {This document provides an introduction to species distribution modeling
with R. Species distribution modeling (SDM) is also known under other names
including climate envelope-modeling, habitat modeling, and (environmental or
ecological) niche-modeling. The aim of SDM is to estimate the similarity of the
conditions at any site to the conditions at the locations of known occurrence
(and perhaps of non-occurrence) of a phenomenon. A common application of
this method is to predict species ranges with climate data as predictors.

In SDM, the following steps are usually taken: (1) locations of occurrence
of a species (or other phenomenon) are compiled; (2) values of environmental
predictor variables (such as climate) at these locations are extracted from spatial
databases; (3) the environmental values are used to t a model to estimate
similarity to the sites of occurrence, or another measure such as abundance of
the species; (4) The model is used to predict the variable of interest across an
the region of interest (and perhaps for a future or past climate).},

User input is a folder of the second-generation sequencing reads sorted by individual (in FASTA format) and pipeline output is a folder of multi-FASTA files that correspond to loci (with 2 alleles called per individual). Additional output includes a summary file of the number of individuals per locus, observed and expected heterozygosity for each locus, distribution of multiple hits and summary statistics (?, Tajima's D, etc.). This user-friendly, open source pipeline, which requires no a priori reference genome because it constructs its own, allows the user to set various parameters (e.g. minimum coverage) in the dependent programs (CAP3, BWA, SAMtools and VarScan) and facilitates evaluation of the nature and quality of data collected prior to analysis in software packages.},

  Abstract                 = {Color vision is an important characteristic of primates and, intriguingly, Neotropical monkeys are highly polymorphic for this trait. Recent field studies have challenged the conventional view that trichromatic color vision is more adaptive than dichromatic color vision. No study has investigated the pattern of genetic variation in the long to middle-wavelength sensitive (L-M or red-green) opsin gene as compared to that of other genomic regions (neutral references) in wild populations of New World monkeys to look for the signature of natural selection. Here we report such a study conducted on spider monkeys and capuchin monkeys inhabiting Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. The nucleotide sequence of the L-M opsin gene was more polymorphic than the sequences of the neutral references, although the opsin gene sequences were not more divergent between the two species than were the sequences of the neutral references. In a coalescence simulation that took into account the observed nucleotide diversity of the neutral references, the Tajima's D value of the L-M opsin gene deviated significantly in a positive direction from the expected range. These results are the first to statistically demonstrate balancing selection acting on the polymorphic L-M opsin gene of New World monkeys. Taking the results of behavioral and genetic studies together, the balancing selection we detected may indicate that coexistence of different color vision types in the same population, also characteristic of humans, is adaptive.},

  Abstract                 = {The coexistence of closely related species is often hampered by resource competition or reproductive interference (interspecific sexual interactions). Species utilising similar signal channels might face substantial problems when they co-occur. It has, therefore, been suggested that reinforcement might drive signal evolution in narrow suture zones of secondary contact. However, species with large overlapping ranges are usually not believed to interact sexually. The Slender Ground-hopper, Tetrix subulata, and the Common Ground-hopper, Tetrix undulata (Orthoptera: Tetrigidae) are sister species, which occur sympatrically in large parts of western and Central Europe, but rarely share the same habitat. It has been hypothesized that reproductive interference might account for their missing coexistence. Here, we test experimentally whether these two species interact sexually. Our results suggest an incomplete premating isolation of these ground-hoppers, as we recorded heterospecific courtship, mating attempts and mating. The number of conspecific copulations and mating attempts of T. subulata decreased substantially in the presence of T. undulata, whereas the latter species was not negatively affected. Males of both species preferred to approach females of T. undulata, whereas females of both species did not discriminate against heterospecific males. Further studies on the reproductive success are needed to clarify whether reproductive interference might influence habitat partitioning between these species.},

  Abstract                 = {The question of how phenotypic variation is maintained within populations has long been a central issue in evolutionary biology. Most of these studies focused on the maintenance of genetic variability, but the phenotype of organisms may also be influenced by environmental cues experienced during ontogeny. Color polymorphism has received particular attention in evolutionary studies as it has strong fitness consequences. However, if body coloration is influenced by the environment, any conclusions on evolutionary consequences of fitness trade-offs can be misleading. Here we present data from a laboratory experiment on the influence of substrate color on three aspects of the coloration of two ground-hopper species, Tetrix subulata and Tetrix ceperoi. We reared hatchlings either on dark or on light substrates, using a split-brood design. Although the type of pronotal pattern changed mainly in response to nymphal development, the basic color was strongly influenced by the substrate color. In both species, black and dark olive color morphs were found more frequently on the dark substrate, whereas the gray color morph dominated on the light substrate. These findings have considerable implications for our understanding of color morph evolution as they show that color polymorphism may not only be maintained by natural selection acting on discrete color morphs, but also by phenotypic plasticity, which enables organisms to adjust to the environmental conditions experienced during ontogeny. This facultative morphology is opposing to the prevailing view of color morph adaptation, which assumes a purely genetic determination and co-evolution of discrete color morphs with life history traits.},

  Abstract                 = {1. As species are often considered discrete natural units, interspecific sexual interactions are often disregarded as potential factors determining community composition. Nevertheless reproductive interference, ranging from signal jamming to hybridization, can have significant costs for species sharing similar signal channels. 2. We combined laboratory and field experiments to test whether the coexistence of two congeneric ground-hopper species with overlapping ranges might be influenced by sexual interactions. 3. In the laboratory experiment the number of conspecific copulations of Tetrix ceperoi decreased substantially in the presence of Tetrix subulata. Males of T. ceperoi performed more mating attempts with heterospecific females, whereas females of T. subulata rejected these heterospecific approaches more often than those of conspecifics. Although no heterospecific matings occurred in the laboratory, the reproductive success of T. ceperoi was reduced substantially in field experiments. Negative effects on T. subulata were found only at high densities. 4. Our results suggest that reproductive interference could have similar consequences as competition, such as demographic displacement of one species ('sexual exclusion'). As reproductive interference should be selected against, it may also drive the evolution of signals (reproductive character displacement) or promote habitat, spatial or temporal segregation.},

  Abstract                 = {Linear amplification for deep sequencing (LADS) is an amplification method that produces representative libraries for Illumina next-generation sequencing within 2 d. The method relies on attaching two different sequencing adapters to blunt-end repaired and A-tailed DNA fragments, wherein one of the adapters is extended with the sequence for the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Ligated and size-selected DNA fragments are transcribed in vitro with high RNA yields. Subsequent cDNA synthesis is initiated from a primer complementary to the first adapter, ensuring that the library will only contain full-length fragments with two distinct adapters. Contrary to the severely biased representation of AT- or GC-rich fragments in standard PCR-amplified libraries, the sequence coverage in T7-amplified libraries is indistinguishable from that of nonamplified libraries. Moreover, in contrast to amplification-free methods, LADS can generate sequencing libraries from a few nanograms of DNA, which is essential for all applications in which the starting material is limited.},

  Abstract                 = {An important tenet of evolutionary developmental biology ("evo devo") is that adaptive mutations affecting morphology are more likely to occur in the cis-regulatory regions than in the protein-coding regions of genes. This argument rests on two claims: (1) the modular nature of cis-regulatory elements largely frees them from deleterious pleiotropic effects, and (2) a growing body of empirical evidence appears to support the predominant role of gene regulatory change in adaptation, especially morphological adaptation. Here we discuss and critique these assertions. We first show that there is no theoretical or empirical basis for the evo devo contention that adaptations involving morphology evolve by genetic mechanisms different from those involving physiology and other traits. In addition, some forms of protein evolution can avoid the negative consequences of pleiotropy, most notably via gene duplication. In light of evo devo claims, we then examine the substantial data on the genetic basis of adaptation from both genome-wide surveys and single-locus studies. Genomic studies lend little support to the cis-regulatory theory: many of these have detected adaptation in protein-coding regions, including transcription factors, whereas few have examined regulatory regions. Turning to single-locus studies, we note that the most widely cited examples of adaptive cis-regulatory mutations focus on trait loss rather than gain, and none have yet pinpointed an evolved regulatory site. In contrast, there are many studies that have both identified structural mutations and functionally verified their contribution to adaptation and speciation. Neither the theoretical arguments nor the data from nature, then, support the claim for a predominance of cis-regulatory mutations in evolution. Although this claim may be true, it is at best premature. Adaptation and speciation probably proceed through a combination of cis-regulatory and structural mutations, with a substantial contribution of the latter.},

  Abstract                 = {Directional selection is a major force driving adaptation and evolutionary change. However, the distribution, strength, and tempo of phenotypic selection acting on quantitative traits in natural populations remain unclear across different study systems. We reviewed the literature (1984-1997) that reported the strength of directional selection as indexed by standardized linear selection gradients (beta). We asked how strong are viability and sexual selection, and whether strength of selection is correlated with the time scale over which it was measured. Estimates of the magnitude of directional selection (absolute value of beta) were exponentially distributed, with few estimates greater than 0.50 and most estimates less than 0.15. Sexual selection (measured by mating success) appeared stronger than viability selection (measured by survival). Viability selection that was measured over short periods (days) was typically stronger than selection measured over longer periods (months and years), but the strength of sexual selection did not vary with duration of selection episodes; as a result, sexual selection was stronger than viability selection over longer time scales (months and years), but not over short time scales (days).},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular ecologists seek to genotype hundreds to thousands of loci from hundreds to thousands of individuals at minimal cost per sample. Current methods, such as restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) and sequence capture, are constrained by costs associated with inefficient use of sequencing data and sample preparation. Here, we introduce RADcap, an approach that combines the major benefits of RADseq (low cost with specific start positions) with those of sequence capture (repeatable sequencing of specific loci) to significantly increase efficiency and reduce costs relative to current approaches. RADcap uses a new version of dual-digest RADseq (3RAD) to identify candidate SNP loci for capture bait design and subsequently uses custom sequence capture baits to consistently enrich candidate SNP loci across many individuals. We combined this approach with a new library preparation method for identifying and removing PCR duplicates from 3RAD libraries, which allows researchers to process RADseq data using traditional pipelines, and we tested the RADcap method by genotyping sets of 96‚Äì384 Wisteria plants. Our results demonstrate that our RADcap method: (i) methodologically reduces (to <5%) and allows computational removal of PCR duplicate reads from data, (ii) achieves 80‚Äì90% reads on target in 11 of 12 enrichments, (iii) returns consistent coverage (‚â•4√ó) across >90% of individuals at up to 99.8% of the targeted loci, (iv) produces consistently high occupancy matrices of genotypes across hundreds of individuals and (v) costs significantly less than current approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a growing appreciation that chromosome inversions affect rates of adaptation, speciation, and the evolution of sex chromosomes. Comparative genomic studies have identified many new paracentric inversion polymorphisms. Population models suggest that inversions can spread by reducing recombination between alleles that independently increase fitness, without epistasis or coadaptation. Areas of linkage disequilibrium extend across large inversions but may be interspersed by areas with little disequilibrium. Genes located within inversions are associated with a variety of traits including those involved in climatic adaptation. Inversion polymorphisms may contribute to speciation by generating underdominance owing to inviable gametes, but an alternative view gaining support is that inversions facilitate speciation by reducing recombination, protecting genomic regions from introgression. Likewise, inversions may facilitate the evolution of sex chromosomes by reducing recombination between sex determining alleles and alleles with sex-specific effects. However, few genes within inversions responsible for fitness effects or speciation have been identified.},

We used restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing to identify a dense set of candidate SNP loci with fixed allelic differences between introduced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and native westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi). We distinguished candidate SNPs from homeologs (paralogs resulting from whole-genome duplication) by detecting excessively high observed heterozygosity and deviations from HardyâWeinberg proportions. We identified 2923 candidate species-specific SNPs from a single Illumina sequencing lane containing 24 barcode-labelled individuals. Published sequence data and ongoing genome sequencing of rainbow trout will allow physical mapping of SNP loci for genome-wide scans and will also provide flanking sequence for design of qPCR-based TaqManÂ® assays for high-throughput, low-cost hybrid identification using a subset of 50â100 loci. This study demonstrates that it is now feasible to identify thousands of informative SNPs in nonmodel species quickly and at reasonable cost, even if no prior genomic information is available.},

This multiplicity leads to the prediction that, in adaptive radiations, sexual isolation results from divergence in multiple dimensions. However, difficulties in directly measuring preferences and detecting multiple effects limit our ability to empirically assess the number of independent traits contributing to mate choice and sexual isolation. We present an approach to estimate the dimensionality of sexual isolation using mating trials across groups of related populations. We analyze nine radiations: seven in fruit flies (Drosophila) and one each in salamanders (Desmognathus) and cichlid fishes (Pseudotropheus). We find strong evidence that multiple latent traits--linear combinations of phenotypic traits and preferences--are responsible for the patterns of sexual isolation in all nine radiations but that dimensionality has a strong upper limit. Just two latent traits are implicated in the majority of cases. Mapping along latent trait axes tests predictions of sexual-selection models and allows correlation with specific phenotypic traits and functional components of mate choice. We find support for the role of stabilizing natural selection on the sexually selected (male) traits. In the cichlids, latent-trait axes incorporate male-coloration patterns and exhibit convergence as well as divergence among populations. In the salamanders, temporal patterning in sensory modalities and male vs. female preferences are reflected in different latent-trait axes.},

We used next-generation sequencing data to examine the patterns of local and long-distance linkage disequilibrium (LD) across oceanic and freshwater populations of threespine stickleback, a useful model for studies of evolution and speciation. We looked for associations between LD and signatures of divergent selection, and assessed the role of recombination rate variation in generating LD patterns. As predicted under the traditional biogeographic model of unidirectional gene flow from ancestral oceanic to derived freshwater stickleback populations, we found extensive local and long-distance LD in fresh water. Surprisingly, oceanic populations showed similar patterns of elevated LD, notably between large genomic regions previously implicated in adaptation to fresh water. These results support an alternative biogeographic model for the stickleback radiation, one of a metapopulation with appreciable bi-directional gene flow combined with strong divergent selection between oceanic and freshwater populations. As predicted by theory, these processes can maintain LD within and among genomic islands of divergence. These findings suggest that the genomic architecture in oceanic stickleback populations may provide a mechanism for the rapid re-assembly and evolution of multi-locus genotypes in newly colonized freshwater habitats, and may help explain genetic mapping of parallel phenotypic variation to similar loci across independent freshwater populations.},

  Abstract                 = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>Oceanic threespine stickleback have invaded and adapted to freshwater habitats countless times across the northern hemisphere. These freshwater populations have often evolved in similar ways from the ancestral marine stock from which they independently derived. With the exception of a few identified genes, the genetic basis of this remarkable parallel adaptation is unclear. Here we show that the parallel phenotypic evolution is matched by parallel patterns of nucleotide diversity and population differentiation across the genome. We used a novel high-throughput sequence-based genotyping approach to produce the first high density genome-wide scans of threespine stickleback populations and identified several genomic regions indicative of both divergent and balancing selection. Some of these regions have been associated previously with traits important for freshwater adaptation, but others were previously unidentified. Within these genomic regions we identified candidate genes, laying the foundation for further genetic and functional study of key pathways. This research illustrates the complementary nature of laboratory mapping, functional genetics, and population genomics.</p>},

The males of the remaining five species of the group produce only one sound pulse during each wing extension/vibration, which results in species-specific songs with long pauses (in D. littoralis about 300 ms) between successive sound pulses. Genetic analyses of the differences between the songs of D. virilis and D. littoralis showed that species-specific song traits are affected by genes on the X chromosome, and for the length of pause, also by genes on chromosomes 3 and 4. The X chromosomal genes having a major impact on pulse and pause length were tightly linked with white, apricot and notched marker genes located at the proximal third of the chromosome. A large inversion in D. littoralis, marked by notched, prevents more precise localization of these genes by classical crossing methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular markers derived from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA are an important part of the toolkit of evolutionary geneticists. Random amplified polymorphic DNA markers (RAPDs), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) polymorphisms allow analysis of species for which previous DNA sequence information is lacking, but dominance makes it impossible to apply standard techniques to calculate F-statistics. We describe a Bayesian method that allows direct estimates of FST from dominant markers. In contrast to existing alternatives, we do not assume previous knowledge of the degree of within-population inbreeding. In particular, we do not assume that genotypes within populations are in Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg proportions. Our estimate of FST incorporates uncertainty about the magnitude of within-population inbreeding. Simulations show that samples from even a relatively small number of loci and populations produce reliable estimates of FST. Moreover, some information about the degree of within-population inbreeding (FIS) is available from data sets with a large number of loci and populations. We illustrate the method with a reanalysis of RAPD data from 14 populations of a North American orchid, Platanthera leucophaea.},

For these reasons and others, F(ST) has a central role in population and evolutionary genetics and has wide applications in fields that range from disease association mapping to forensic science.

We compare and contrast these new sequencing platforms in terms of stage of development, instrument configuration, template format, sequencing chemistry, throughput capability, operating cost, data handling issues, and error models. While these platforms outperform capillary instruments in terms of bases per day and cost per base, the short length of sequence reads obtained from most instruments and the limited number of samples that can be run simultaneously imposes some practical constraints on sequencing applications. However, recently developed methods for paired-end sequencing and for array-based direct selection of desired templates from complex mixtures extend the utility of these platforms for genome analysis. Given the ever increasing demand for DNA sequence information, we can expect continuous improvement of this new generation of instruments and their eventual replacement by even more powerful technology.},

However, like the analysis of microarray data and the assembly and annotation of complete genome sequences from conventional sequencing data, the management and analysis of next-generation sequencing data requires (and indeed has already driven) the development of informatics tools able to assemble, map, and interpret huge quantities of relatively or extremely short nucleotide sequence data.

  Abstract                 = {There are two distinct reasons for making comparisons of genetic variation for quantitative characters. The first is to compare evolvabilities, or ability to respond to selection, and the second is to make inferences about the forces that maintain genetic variability. Measures of variation that are standardized by the trait mean, such as the additive genetic coefficient of variation, are appropriate for both purposes. Variation has usually been compared as narrow sense heritabilities, but this is almost always an inappropriate comparative measure of evolvability and variability. Coefficients of variation were calculated from 842 estimates of trait means, variances and heritabilities in the literature. Traits closely related to fitness have higher additive genetic and nongenetic variability by the coefficient of variation criterion than characters under weak selection. This is the reverse of the accepted conclusion based on comparisons of heritability. The low heritability of fitness components is best explained by their high residual variation. The high additive genetic and residual variability of fitness traits might be explained by the great number of genetic and environmental events they are affected by, or by a lack of stabilizing selection to reduce their phenotypic variance. Over one-third of the quantitative genetics papers reviewed did not report trait means or variances. Researchers should always report these statistics, so that measures of variation appropriate to a variety of situations may be calculated.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) is a genome complexity reduction technique that facilitates large-scale marker discovery and genotyping by sequencing. Recent applications of RAD-Seq have included linkage and QTL mapping with a particular focus on non-model species. In the current study, we have applied RAD-Seq to two Atlantic salmon families from a commercial breeding program. The offspring from these families were classified into resistant or susceptible based on survival/mortality in an Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis (IPN) challenge experiment, and putative homozygous resistant or susceptible genotype at a major IPN-resistance QTL. From each family, the genomic DNA of the two heterozygous parents and seven offspring of each IPN phenotype and genotype was digested with the SbfI enzyme and sequenced in multiplexed pools.RESULTS:Sequence was obtained from approximately 70,000 RAD loci in both families and a filtered set of 6,712 segregating SNPs were identified. Analyses of genome-wide RAD marker segregation patterns in the two families suggested SNP discovery on all 29 Atlantic salmon chromosome pairs, and highlighted the dearth of male recombination. \textbf{The use of pedigreed samples allowed us to distinguish segregating SNPs from putative paralogous sequence variants resulting from the relatively recent genome duplication of salmonid species.} Of the segregating SNPs, 50 were linked to the QTL. A subset of these QTL-linked SNPs were converted to a high-throughput assay and genotyped across large commercial populations of IPNV-challenged salmon fry. Several SNPs showed highly significant linkage and association with resistance to IPN, and population linkage-disequilibrium-based SNP tests for resistance were identified.CONCLUSIONS:We used RAD-Seq to successfully identify and characterise high-density genetic markers in pedigreed aquaculture Atlantic salmon. These results underline the effectiveness of RAD-Seq as a tool for rapid and efficient generation of QTL-targeted and genome-wide marker data in a large complex genome, and its possible utility in farmed animal selection programs.},

  Abstract                 = {Genotype imputation methods are now being widely used in the analysis of genome-wide association studies. Most imputation analyses to date have used the HapMap as a reference dataset, but new reference panels (such as controls genotyped on multiple SNP chips and densely typed samples from the 1,000 Genomes Project) will soon allow a broader range of SNPs to be imputed with higher accuracy, thereby increasing power. We describe a genotype imputation method (IMPUTE version 2) that is designed to address the challenges presented by these new datasets. The main innovation of our approach is a flexible modelling framework that increases accuracy and combines information across multiple reference panels while remaining computationally feasible. We find that IMPUTE v2 attains higher accuracy than other methods when the HapMap provides the sole reference panel, but that the size of the panel constrains the improvements that can be made. We also find that imputation accuracy can be greatly enhanced by expanding the reference panel to contain thousands of chromosomes and that IMPUTE v2 outperforms other methods in this setting at both rare and common SNPs, with overall error rates that are 15\%-20\% lower than those of the closest competing method. One particularly challenging aspect of next-generation association studies is to integrate information across multiple reference panels genotyped on different sets of SNPs; we show that our approach to this problem has practical advantages over other suggested solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Draft de novo genome assemblies are now available for many organisms. These assemblies are point estimates of the true genome sequences. Each is a specific hypothesis, drawn from among many alternative hypotheses, of the sequence of a genome. Assembly uncertainty, the inability to distinguish between multiple alternative assembly hypotheses, can be due to real variation between copies of the genome in the sample, errors and ambiguities in the sequenced data and assumptions and heuristics of the assemblers. Most assemblers select a single assembly according to ad hoc criteria, and do not yet report and quantify the uncertainty of their outputs. Those assemblers that do report uncertainty take different approaches to describing multiple assembly hypotheses and the support for each.Results: Here we review and examine the problem of representing and measuring uncertainty in assemblies. A promising recent development is the implementation of assemblers that are built according to explicit statistical models. Some new assembly methods, for example, estimate and maximize assembly likelihood. These advances, combined with technical advances in the representation of alternative assembly hypotheses, will lead to a more complete and biologically relevant understanding of assembly uncertainty. This will in turn facilitate the interpretation of downstream analyses and tests of specific biological hypotheses.Contact: mhowison@brown.edu},

To identify genomic targets of adaptation, we sequenced the genomes of four Biaka Pygmies from the Central African Republic and jointly analyzed these data with the genome sequences of three Baka Pygmies from Cameroon and nine Yoruba famers. To account for the complex demographic history of these populations that includes both isolation and gene flow, we fit models using the joint allele frequency spectrum and validated them using independent approaches. Our two best-fit models both suggest ancient divergence between the ancestors of the farmers and Pygmies, 90,000 or 150,000 yr ago. We also find that bidirectional asymmetric gene flow is statistically better supported than a single pulse of unidirectional gene flow from farmers to Pygmies, as previously suggested. We then applied complementary statistics to scan the genome for evidence of selective sweeps and polygenic selection. We found that conventional statistical outlier approaches were biased toward identifying candidates in regions of high mutation or low recombination rate. To avoid this bias, we assigned P-values for candidates using whole-genome simulations incorporating demography and variation in both recombination and mutation rates. We found that genes and gene sets involved in muscle development, bone synthesis, immunity, reproduction, cell signaling and development, and energy metabolism are likely to be targets of positive natural selection in Western African Pygmies or their recent ancestors.},

One implication of these findings is that some adaptive features in contemporary humans may have entered the population via gene flow with archaic forms in Eurasia. Within Africa, fossil evidence suggests that anatomically modern humans (AMH) and various archaic forms coexisted for much of the last 200,000 yr; however, the absence of ancient DNA in Africa has limited our ability to make a direct comparison between archaic and modern human genomes. Here, we use statistical inference based on high coverage whole-genome data (greater than 60×) from contemporary African Pygmy hunter-gatherers as an alternative means to study the evolutionary history of the genus Homo. Using whole-genome simulations that consider demographic histories that include both isolation and gene flow with neighboring farming populations, our inference method rejects the hypothesis that the ancestors of AMH were genetically isolated in Africa, thus providing model-based whole genome-level evidence of African archaic admixture. Our inferences also suggest a complex human evolutionary history in Africa, which involves at least a single admixture event from an unknown archaic population into the ancestors of AMH, likely within the last 30,000 yr.},

  Abstract                 = {The disproportionately large involvement of the X-chromosome in the isolation of closely related species (the large-X effect) has been reported for many animals, where X-linked genes are mostly hemizygous in the heterogametic sex. The expression of deleterious recessive mutations is thought to drive the frequent involvement of the X-chromosome in hybrid sterility, as well as to reduce interspecific gene flow for X-linked genes. Here, we evaluate the role of the X-chromosome in the speciation of two closely related plant species ‚Äì the white and red campions (Silene latifolia and S.¬†dioica) ‚Äì that hybridize widely across Europe. The two species evolved separate sexes and sex chromosomes relatively recently (~107¬†years), and unlike most animal species, most X-linked genes have intact Y-linked homologs. We demonstrate that the X-linked genes show a very small and insignificant amount of interspecific gene flow, while gene flow involving autosomal loci is significant and sufficient to homogenize the gene pools of the two species. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of the large-X effect in Silene and comprise the first report of this effect in plants. Nonhemizygosity of many X-linked genes in Silene males indicates that exposure of recessive mutations to selection may not be essential for the occurrence of the large-X effect. Several possible causes of the large-X effect in Silene are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) is a community resource of 205 sequenced inbred lines, derived to improve our understanding of the effects of naturally occurring genetic variation on molecular and organismal phenotypes. We used an integrated genotyping strategy to identify 4,853,802 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1,296,080 non-SNP variants. Our molecular population genomic analyses show higher deletion than insertion mutation rates and stronger purifying selection on deletions. Weaker selection on insertions than deletions is consistent with our observed distribution of genome size determined by flow cytometry, which is skewed toward larger genomes. Insertion/deletion and single nucleotide polymorphisms are positively correlated with each other and with local recombination, suggesting that their nonrandom distributions are due to hitchhiking and background selection. Our cytogenetic analysis identified 16 polymorphic inversions in the DGRP. Common inverted and standard karyotypes are genetically divergent and account for most of the variation in relatedness among the DGRP lines. Intriguingly, variation in genome size and many quantitative traits are significantly associated with inversions. Approximately 50% of the DGRP lines are infected with Wolbachia, and four lines have germline insertions of Wolbachia sequences, but effects of Wolbachia infection on quantitative traits are rarely significant. The DGRP complements ongoing efforts to functionally annotate the Drosophila genome. Indeed, 15% of all D. melanogaster genes segregate for potentially damaged proteins in the DGRP, and genome-wide analyses of quantitative traits identify novel candidate genes. The DGRP lines, sequence data, genotypes, quality scores, phenotypes, and analysis and visualization tools are publicly available.},

  Abstract                 = {The next-generation sequencing technology coupled with the growing number of genome sequences opens the opportunity to redesign genotyping strategies for more effective genetic mapping and genome analysis. We have developed a high-throughput method for genotyping recombinant populations utilizing whole-genome resequencing data generated by the Illumina Genome Analyzer. A sliding window approach is designed to collectively examine genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms for genotype calling and recombination breakpoint determination. Using this method, we constructed a genetic map for 150 rice recombinant inbred lines with an expected genotype calling accuracy of 99.94\% and a resolution of recombination breakpoints within an average of 40 kb. In comparison to the genetic map constructed with 287 PCR-based markers for the rice population, the sequencing-based method was approximately 20x faster in data collection and 35x more precise in recombination breakpoint determination. Using the sequencing-based genetic map, we located a quantitative trait locus of large effect on plant height in a 100-kb region containing the rice "green revolution" gene. Through computer simulation, we demonstrate that the method is robust for different types of mapping populations derived from organisms with variable quality of genome sequences and is feasible for organisms with large genome sizes and low polymorphisms. With continuous advances in sequencing technologies, this genome-based method may replace the conventional marker-based genotyping approach to provide a powerful tool for large-scale gene discovery and for addressing a wide range of biological questions.},

It uses base quality values in computation of overlaps between reads, construction of multiple sequence alignments of reads, and generation of consensus sequences. The program also uses forward-reverse constraints to correct assembly errors and link contigs. Results of CAP3 on four BAC data sets are presented. The performance of CAP3 was compared with that of PHRAP on a number of BAC data sets. PHRAP often produces longer contigs than CAP3 whereas CAP3 often produces fewer errors in consensus sequences than PHRAP. It is easier to construct scaffolds with CAP3 than with PHRAP on low-pass data with forward-reverse constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {Detecting positive selection in species with heterogeneous habitats and complex demography is notoriously difficult and prone to statistical biases. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana exemplifies this problem: In spite of the large amounts of data, little evidence for classic selective sweeps has been found. Moreover, many aspects of the demography are unclear, which makes it hard to judge whether the few signals are indeed signs of selection, or false positives caused by demographic events. Here, we focus on Swedish A. thaliana and we find that the demography can be approximated as a two-population model. Careful analysis of the data shows that such a two island model is characterized by a very old split time that significantly predates the last glacial maximum followed by secondary contact with strong migration. We evaluate selection based on this demography and find that this secondary contact model strongly affects the power to detect sweeps. Moreover, it affects the power differently for northern Sweden (more false positives) as compared with southern Sweden (more false negatives). However, even when the demographic history is accounted for, sweep signals in northern Sweden are stronger than in southern Sweden, with little or no positional overlap. Further simulations including the complex demography and selection confirm that this is not compatible with global selection acting on both populations, and thus can be taken as evidence for local selection within subpopulations of Swedish A. thaliana. This study demonstrates the necessity of combining demographic analyses and sweep scans for the detection of selection, particularly when selection acts predominantly local.},

In two tissues important to the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome, we mapped cis- and trans-regulatory control elements for expression of thousands of genes across the genome. Many of the most highly linked expression quantitative trait loci are regulated in cis, are inherited essentially as monogenic traits and are good candidate genes for previously mapped physiological quantitative trait loci in the rat. By comparative mapping we generated a data set of 73 candidate genes for hypertension that merit testing in human populations. Mining of this publicly available data set is expected to lead to new insights into the genes and regulatory pathways underlying the extensive range of metabolic and cardiovascular disease phenotypes that segregate in these recombinant inbred strains.},

Formulas are derived for the mean and variance of R. In contrast to R, RM can be determined from the sample. Since no formulas are known for the mean and variance of RM, they are estimated with Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that RM is often much less than R, therefore, the number of recombination events may be greatly under-estimated in a parsimonious reconstruction of the history of a sample. The statistic RM can be used to estimate the product of the recombination rate and the population size or, if the recombination rate is known, to estimate the population size. To illustrate this, DNA sequences from the Adh region of Drosophila melanogaster are used to estimate the effective population size of this species.},

  Abstract                 = {Life on Earth has repeatedly displayed abrupt and massive changes in the past, and there is no reason to expect that comparable planetary-scale regime shifts will not continue in the future. Different lines of evidence indicate that regime shifts occur when the climate or biosphere transgresses a tipping point. Whether human activities will trigger such a global event in the near future is uncertain, due to critical knowledge gaps. In particular, we lack understanding of how regime shifts propagate across scales, and whether local or regional tipping points can lead to global transitions. The ongoing disruption of ecosystems and climate, combined with unprecedented breakdown of isolation by human migration and trade, highlights the need to operate within safe planetary boundaries.},

  Abstract                 = {DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic mark known to have wide-ranging effects on gene regulation in a variety of animal taxa. Comparative genomic analyses can help elucidate the function of DNA methylation by identifying conserved features of methylated genes and other genomic regions. In this study, we used computational approaches to distinguish genes marked by heavy methylation from those marked by little or no methylation in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. We investigated if these two classes had distinct evolutionary histories and functional roles by conducting comparative analysis with the honeybee, Apis (Ap.) mellifera. We found that highly methylated orthologs in A. pisum and Ap. mellifera exhibited greater conservation of methylation status, suggesting that highly methylated genes in ancestral species may remain highly methylated over time. We also found that methylated genes tended to show different rates of evolution than unmethylated genes. In addition, genes targeted by methylation were enriched for particular biological processes that differed from those in relatively unmethylated genes. Finally, methylated genes were preferentially ubiquitously expressed among alternate phenotypes in both species, whereas genes lacking signatures of methylation were preferentially associated with condition-specific gene regulation expression. Overall, our analyses support a conserved role for DNA methylation in insects with comparable methylation systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been a marker of choice for reconstructing historical patterns of
population demography, admixture, biogeography and speciation. However, it has recently been suggested
that the pervasive nature of direct and indirect selection on this molecule renders any conclusion derived
from it ambiguous. We review here the evidence for indirect selection on mtDNA in arthropods arising
from linkage disequilibrium with maternally inherited symbionts. We note first that these symbionts are
very common in arthropods and then review studies that reveal the extent to which they shape mtDNA
evolution. mtDNA diversity patterns are compatible with neutral expectations for an uninfected
population in only 2 of 19 cases. The remaining 17 studies revealed cases of symbiont-driven reduction in
mtDNA diversity, symbiont-driven increases in diversity, symbiont-driven changes in mtDNA variation
over space and symbiont-associated paraphylyof mtDNA. We therefore conclude that these elements often
confound the inference of an organism’s evolutionary history from mtDNA data and that mtDNA on its
own is an unsuitable marker for the study of recent historical events in arthropods. We also discuss the
impact of these studies on the current programme of taxonomy based on DNA bar-coding.},

Addressing this issue, we use published genomes from a tunicate, stickleback, and soybean to illustrate the potential for bioinformatic artifacts and introduce a protocol to minimize two sources of error expected from similarity-based de-novo clustering of stacked reads: the splitting of alleles into different clusters, which creates false homozygosity, and the grouping of paralogs into the same cluster, which creates false heterozygosity. We present an empirical application focused on Ciona savignyi, a tunicate with very high SNP heterozygosity (~0.05), because high diversity challenges the computational efficiency of most existing nonmodel pipelines while also potentially exacerbating paralog artifacts. \textbf{The simulated and empirical data illustrate the advantages of using higher sequence difference clustering thresholds than is typical and demonstrate the utility of our protocol for efficiently identifying an optimum threshold from data without prior knowledge of heterozygosity.} The empirical Ciona savignyi data also highlight null alleles as a potentially large source of false homozygosity in restriction-based reduced representation genomic data.},

Second, we identify more than 3 Mb of sequence absent from the human reference genome, in pooled low-coverage population sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project. Third, we show how population information from ten chimpanzees enables accurate variant calls without a reference sequence.

  Abstract                 = {An analysis of dinucleotide frequencies was carried out on DNAs from insects and mammals, as well as on large DNA sequences from the genomes of Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, puffer fish (Takifugu rubripes), zebra fish (Danio rerio) and human. These organisms were chosen because Drosophila and Anopheles DNAs have an extremely low level of methylation, human DNA a high level and fish DNA a two-fold higher level compared to human. The results indicate that: (i) CpG deficiency and the corresponding TpG (CpA) excess show no correlation with the level of DNA methylation; indeed, genomes endowed with strikingly different levels of DNA methylation (such as those of Drosophila and human) exhibited similar TpG (CpA) levels; (ii) the correlation between GC levels of large (50 kb) DNA sequences and TpA or CpG shortage levels do not appear to be due to CpG methylation followed by deamination; (iii) CpG dinucleotides are more frequent in fishes than in mammals; interestingly, the monotreme Ornitorhinchus anatinus shows an intermediate CpG frequency. The implications of these results are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {
 A variety of methods are available to collapse 16S rRNA gene sequencing reads to the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) used in microbiome analyses. A number of studies have aimed to compare the quality of the resulting OTUs. However, in the absence of a standard method to define and enumerate the different taxa within a microbial community, existing comparisons have been unable to compare the ability of clustering methods to generate units that accurately represent functional taxonomic segregation. We have previously demonstrated heritability of the microbiome and we propose this as a measure of each methods‚Äô ability to generate OTUs representing biologically relevant units. Our approach assumes that OTUs that best represent the functional units interacting with the hosts‚Äô properties will produce the highest heritability estimates. Using 1,750 unselected individuals from the TwinsUK cohort, we compared 11 approaches to OTU clustering in heritability analyses. We find that de novo clustering methods produce more heritable OTUs than reference based approaches, with VSEARCH and SUMACLUST performing well. We also show that differences resulting from each clustering method are minimal once reads are collapsed by taxonomic assignment, although sample diversity estimates are clearly influenced by OTU clustering approach. These results should help the selection of sequence clustering methods in future microbiome studies, particularly for studies of human host-microbiome interactions.

  Abstract                 = {Processes leading to speciation in oceanic environments without obvious physical barriers remain poorly known. European and American eel (Anguilla anguilla and A. rostrata) spawn in partial sympatry in the Sargasso Sea. Larvae are advected by the Gulf Stream and other currents towards the European/North African and North American coasts, respectively. We analyzed 104 mitogenomes from the two species along with mitogenomes of other Anguilla and outgroup species. We estimated divergence time between the two species to identify major events involved in speciation. We also considered two previously stated hypotheses: one where the ancestral species was present in only one continent but was advected across the Atlantic by ocean current changes and another where population declines during Pleistocene glaciations led to increasing vicariance, facilitating speciation. Divergence time was estimated to ∼3.38 Mya, coinciding with the closure of the Panama Gateway that led to reinforcement of the Gulf Stream. This could have advected larvae towards European/North African coasts, in which case American eel would be expected to be the ancestral species. This scenario could, however, not be unequivocally confirmed by analyses of dN/dS, nucleotide diversity and effective population size estimates. Extended bayesian skyline plots showed fluctuations of effective population sizes and declines during glaciations, and thus also lending support to the importance of vicariance during speciation. There was evidence for positive selection at the ATP6 and possibly ND5 genes, indicating a role in speciation. The findings suggest an important role of ocean current changes in speciation of marine organisms.},

  Abstract                 = {F(ST) is frequently used as a summary of genetic differentiation among groups. It has been suggested that F(ST) depends on the allele frequencies at a locus, as it exhibits a variety of peculiar properties related to genetic diversity: higher values for biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) than for multiallelic microsatellites, low values among high-diversity populations viewed as substantially distinct, and low values for populations that differ primarily in their profiles of rare alleles. A full mathematical understanding of the dependence of F(ST) on allele frequencies, however, has been elusive. Here, we examine the relationship between F(ST) and the frequency of the most frequent allele, demonstrating that the range of values that F(ST) can take is restricted considerably by the allele-frequency distribution. For a two-population model, we derive strict bounds on F(ST) as a function of the frequency M of the allele with highest mean frequency between the pair of populations. Using these bounds, we show that for a value of M chosen uniformly between 0 and 1 at a multiallelic locus whose number of alleles is left unspecified, the mean maximum F(ST) is ∼0.3585. Further, F(ST) is restricted to values much less than 1 when M is low or high, and the contribution to the maximum F(ST) made by the most frequent allele is on average ∼0.4485. Using bounds on homozygosity that we have previously derived as functions of M, we describe strict bounds on F(ST) in terms of the homozygosity of the total population, finding that the mean maximum F(ST) given this homozygosity is 1 - ln 2 ≈ 0.3069. Our results provide a conceptual basis for understanding the dependence of F(ST) on allele frequencies and genetic diversity and for interpreting the roles of these quantities in computations of F(ST) from population-genetic data. Further, our analysis suggests that many unusual observations of F(ST), including the relatively low F(ST) values in high-diversity human populations from Africa and the relatively low estimates of F(ST) for microsatellites compared to SNPs, can be understood not as biological phenomena associated with different groups of populations or classes of markers but rather as consequences of the intrinsic mathematical dependence of F(ST) on the properties of allele-frequency distributions.},

We show that patterns of linkage disequilibrium recently proposed to be unique to hitchhiking models are replicated under nonequilibrium neutral models. We also demonstrate that jointly considering spatial patterns of association among variants alongside the site-frequency spectrum is nonetheless of value. Through a comparison of models of equilibrium neutrality, nonequilibrium neutrality, equilibrium hitchhiking, nonequilibrium hitchhiking, and recurrent hitchhiking, we evaluate a linkage disequilibrium (LD) statistic (omega(max)) that appears to have power to identify regions recently shaped by positive selection. Most notably, for demographic parameters relevant to non-African populations of Drosophila melanogaster, we demonstrate that selected loci are distinguishable from neutral loci using this statistic.},

  Abstract                 = {Current global patterns of biodiversity result from processes that operate over both space and time and thus require an integrated macroecological and macroevolutionary perspective. Molecular time trees have advanced our understanding of the tempo and mode of diversification and have identified remarkable adaptive radiations across the tree of life. However, incomplete joint phylogenetic and geographic sampling has limited broad-scale inference. Thus, the relative prevalence of rapid radiations and the importance of their geographic settings in shaping global biodiversity patterns remain unclear. Here we present, analyse and map the first complete dated phylogeny of all 9,993 extant species of birds, a widely studied group showing many unique adaptations. We find that birds have undergone a strong increase in diversification rate from about 50 million years ago to the near present. This acceleration is due to a number of significant rate increases, both within songbirds and within other young and mostly temperate radiations including the waterfowl, gulls and woodpeckers. Importantly, species characterized with very high past diversification rates are interspersed throughout the avian tree and across geographic space. Geographically, the major differences in diversification rates are hemispheric rather than latitudinal, with bird assemblages in Asia, North America and southern South America containing a disproportionate number of species from recent rapid radiations. The contribution of rapidly radiating lineages to both temporal diversification dynamics and spatial distributions of species diversity illustrates the benefits of an inclusive geographical and taxonomical perspective. Overall, whereas constituent clades may exhibit slowdowns, the adaptive zone into which modern birds have diversified since the Cretaceous may still offer opportunities for diversification.},

To determine the typical strength and direction of assortative mating in animals, we carried out a meta-analysis of published measures of assortative mating for a variety of phenotypic and genotypic traits in a diverse set of animal taxa. We focused on the strength of assortment within populations, excluding reproductively isolated populations and species. We collected 1,116 published correlations between mated pairs from 254 species (360 unique species-trait combinations) in five phyla. The mean correlation between mates was 0.28, showing an overall tendency toward positive assortative mating within populations. Although 19% of the correlations were negative, simulations suggest that these could represent type I error and that negative assortative mating may be rare. We also find significant differences in the strength of assortment among major taxonomic groups and among trait categories. We discuss various possible reasons for the evolution of assortative mating and its implications for speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies, primarily in Drosophila, have greatly advanced our understanding of Haldane's rule, the tendency for hybrid sterility or inviability to affect primarily the heterogametic sex (Haldane 1922). Although dominance theory (Turelli and Orr 1995) has been proposed as a general explanation of Haldane's rule, this remains to be tested in female-heterogametic taxa, such as the Lepidoptera. Here we describe a novel example of Haldane's rule in Heliconius melpomene (Lepidoptera; Nymphalidae). Female F1 offspring are sterile when a male from French Guiana is crossed to a female from Panama, but fertile in the reciprocal cross. Male F1s are fertile in both directions. Similar female F1 sterility occurs in crosses between French Guiana and eastern Colombian populations. Backcrosses and linkage analysis show that sterility results from an interaction between gene(s) on the Z chromosome of the Guiana race with autosomal factors in the Panama genome. Large X (or Z) effects are commonly observed in Drosophila, but to our knowledge have not been previously demonstrated for hybrid sterility in Lepidoptera. Differences in the abundance of male versus female or Z-linked versus autosomal sterility factors cannot be ruled out in our crosses as causes of Haldane's rule. Nonetheless, the demonstration that recessive Z-linked loci cause hybrid sterility in a female heterogametic species supports the contention that dominance theory provides a general explanation of Haldane's rule (Turelli and Orr 2000).},

  Abstract                 = {Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are tandemly repeated DNA sequences, including tandem copies of specific sequences no longer than six bases, that are distributed in the genome. SSR has been used as a molecular marker because it is easy to detect and is used in a range of applications, including genetic diversity, genome mapping, and marker assisted selection. It is also very mutable because of slipping in the DNA polymerase during DNA replication. This unique mutation increases the insertion/deletion (INDELs) mutation frequency to a high ratio - more than other types of molecular markers such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs).SNPs are more frequent than INDELs. Therefore, all designed algorithms for sequence alignment fit the vast majority of the genomic sequence without considering microsatellite regions, as unique sequences that require special consideration. The old algorithm is limited in its application because there are many overlaps between different repeat units which result in false evolutionary relationships.To overcome the limitation of the aligning algorithm when dealing with SSR loci, a new algorithm was developed using PERL script with a Tk graphical interface. This program is based on aligning sequences after determining the repeated units first, and the last SSR nucleotides positions. This results in a shifting process according to the inserted repeated unit type.When studying the phylogenic relations before and after applying the new algorithm, many differences in the trees were obtained by increasing the SSR length and complexity. However, less distance between different linage had been observed after applying the new algorithm.The new algorithm produces better estimates for aligning SSR loci because it reflects more reliable evolutionary relations between different linages. It reduces overlapping during SSR alignment, which results in a more realistic phylogenic relationship.},

It also has unusual genetic properties, being mainly due to interactions between at least two genes. Recent studies have identified some of the interacting genes that underlie hybrid incompatibility. These genes represent a wide array of functions, including those involved in oxidative respiration, nuclear trafficking, DNA-binding, and plant defense. Accumulating evidence suggests genomic conflict frequently drives the divergence causing incompatibilities in hybrids. The evidence bearing on this genomic conflict hypothesis is assessed and ways to test it conclusively are suggested.},

We report a new method for inferring the scaled mutation rate, theta = 2Neu, and the scaled exponential growth rate, R = Ner, from the site-frequency spectrum of these data while accounting for sequencing error via Phred quality scores. After obtaining maximum likelihood parameter estimates for theta and R, we calculate empirical Bayes quality scores reflecting the posterior probability that each apparently polymorphic site is truly polymorphic; these scores can then be used for other applications such as SNP discovery. For realistic parameter ranges, analytic and simulation results show our estimates to be essentially unbiased with tight confidence intervals. In contrast, choosing an arbitrary quality score cutoff (e.g., trimming reads) and ignoring further quality information during inference yields biased estimates with greater variance. We illustrate the use of our technique on a new project analyzing activated sludge from a lab-scale bioreactor seeded by a wastewater treatment plant.},

  Abstract                 = {GST and its relatives are often interpreted as measures of differentiation between subpopulations, with values near zero supposedly indicating low differentiation. However, GST necessarily approaches zero when gene diversity is high, even if subpopulations are completely differentiated, and it is not monotonic with increasing differentiation. Likewise, when diversity is equated with heterozygosity, standard similarity measures formed by taking the ratio of mean within-subpopulation diversity to total diversity necessarily approach unity when diversity is high, even if the subpopulations are completely dissimilar (no shared alleles). None of these measures can be interpreted as measures of differentiation or similarity. The derivations of these measures contain two subtle misconceptions which cause their paradoxical behaviours. Conclusions about population differentiation, gene flow, relatedness, and conservation priority will often be wrong when based on these fixation indices or similarity measures. These are not statistical issues; the problems persist even when true population frequencies are used in the calculations. Recent advances in the mathematics of diversity identify the misconceptions, and yield mathematically consistent descriptive measures of population structure which eliminate the paradoxes produced by standard measures. These measures can be directly related to the migration and mutation rates of the finite-island model.},

To characterize the conditions under which such recombinant amplification products form we monitored the exchange of sequence between two homologous templates carrying different restriction sites separated by 282 bp. Using a typical cycling program the rates of recombination between the two restriction sites were 1 and 7\% using Taq and Vent polymerases respectively over 12 doublings. However, by using long elongation times and cycling only to the mid-point of the amplification recombination could be suppressed below visual detection with both polymerases. Conversely, cycling programs designed to promote incomplete primer elongation and subsequent template strand exchange stimulated recombination to >20\%.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of ecosystems can exhibit abrupt shifts between alternative stable states. Because of their important ecological and economic consequences, recent research has focused on devising early warning signals for anticipating such abrupt ecological transitions. In particular, theoretical studies show that changes in spatial characteristics of the system could provide early warnings of approaching transitions. However, the empirical validation of these indicators lag behind their theoretical developments. Here, we summarize a range of currently available spatial early warning signals, suggest potential null models to interpret their trends, and apply them to three simulated spatial data sets of systems undergoing an abrupt transition. In addition to providing a step-by-step methodology for applying these signals to spatial data sets, we propose a statistical toolbox that may be used to help detect approaching transitions in a wide range of spatial data. We hope that our methodology together with the computer codes will stimulate the application and testing of spatial early warning signals on real spatial data.},

Now, a new generation of high-throughput sequencing technologies promises to again transform the scientific enterprise, potentially supplanting array-based technologies and opening up many new possibilities. By allowing DNA/RNA to be assayed more rapidly than previously possible, these next-generation platforms promise a deeper understanding of genome regulation and biology. Significantly enhancing sequencing throughput will allow us to follow the evolution of viral and bacterial resistance in real time, to uncover the huge diversity of novel genes that are currently inaccessible, to understand nucleic acid therapeutics, to better integrate biological information for a complete picture of health and disease at a personalized level and to move to advances that we cannot yet imagine.},

  Abstract                 = {Although many de novo genome assembly projects have recently been conducted using high-throughput sequencers, assembling highly heterozygous diploid genomes is a substantial challenge due to the increased complexity of the de Bruijn graph structure predominantly used. To address the increasing demand for sequencing of nonmodel and/or wild-type samples, in most cases inbred lines or fosmid-based hierarchical sequencing methods are used to overcome such problems. However, these methods are costly and time consuming, forfeiting the advantages of massive parallel sequencing. Here, we describe a novel de novo assembler, Platanus, that can effectively manage high-throughput data from heterozygous samples. Platanus assembles DNA fragments (reads) into contigs by constructing de Bruijn graphs with automatically optimized k-mer sizes followed by the scaffolding of contigs based on paired-end information. The complicated graph structures that result from the heterozygosity are simplified during not only the contig assembly step but also the scaffolding step. We evaluated the assembly results on eukaryotic samples with various levels of heterozygosity. Compared with other assemblers, Platanus yields assembly results that have a larger scaffold NG50 length without any accompanying loss of accuracy in both simulated and real data. In addition, Platanus recorded the largest scaffold NG50 values for two of the three low-heterozygosity species used in the de novo assembly contest, Assemblathon 2. Platanus therefore provides a novel and efficient approach for the assembly of gigabase-sized highly heterozygous genomes and is an attractive alternative to the existing assemblers designed for genomes of lower heterozygosity.},

  Abstract                 = { A wide range of studies in population genetics have employed the sample frequency spectrum (SFS), a summary statistic which describes the distribution of mutant alleles at a polymorphic site in a sample of DNA sequences and provides a highly efficient dimensional reduction of large-scale population genomic variation data. Recently, there has been much interest in analyzing the joint SFS data from multiple populations to infer parameters of complex demographic histories, including variable population sizes, population split times, migration rates, admixture proportions, and so on. SFS-based inference methods require accurate computation of the expected SFS under a given demographic model. Although much methodological progress has been made, existing methods suffer from numerical instability and high computational complexity when multiple populations are involved and the sample size is large. In this paper, we present new analytic formulas and algorithms that enable accurate, efficient computation of the expected joint SFS for thousands of individuals sampled from hundreds of populations related by a complex demographic model with arbitrary population size histories (including piecewise-exponential growth). Our results are implemented in a new software package called momi (MOran Models for Inference). Through an empirical study we demonstrate our improvements to numerical stability and computational complexity. },

Here we examine gene flow across the entire range of the common sunflower, H. annuus, its historically allopatric sister species H. argophyllus and a more distantly related, sympatric relative H. petiolaris. Analysis of genotypes at 26 microsatellite loci in 1015 individuals from across the range of the three species showed substantial introgression between geographically proximal populations of H. annuus and H. petiolaris, limited introgression between H. annuus and H. argophyllus, and essentially no gene flow between the allopatric pair, H. argophyllus and H. petiolaris. Analysis of sequence divergence levels among the three species in 1420 orthologs identified from EST databases identified a subset of loci showing extremely low divergence between H. annuus and H. petiolaris and extremely high divergence between the sister species H. annuus and H. argophyllus, consistent with introgression between H. annuus and H. petiolaris at these loci. Thus, at many loci, the allopatric sister species are more genetically divergent than the more distantly related sympatric species, which have exchanged genes across much of the genome while remaining morphologically and ecologically distinct. },

Comprehensive assessment of the phase-related expression revealed that, whereas most of the genes in various categories from hind legs and the midgut are down-regulated in the gregarious phase, several gene classes in the head are impressively up-regulated, including those with peptidase, receptor, and oxygen-binding activities and those related to development, cell growth, and responses to external stimuli. Among them, a superfamily of proteins, the JHPH super-family, which includes juvenile hormone-binding protein, hexamerins, prophenoloxidase, and hemocyanins, were highly expressed in the heads of the gregarious hoppers and hind legs of the solitary hoppers. Quantitative PCR experiments confirmed in part the EST results. These differentially regulated genes have strong functional implications that numerous molecular activities are involved in phase plasticity. This study provides ample molecular markers and genomic information on hemimetabolous insects and insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms of phase changes in locusts.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe the isolation and characterization of two missense mutations in the cytosine-DNA-methyltransferase gene, MET1, from the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Both missense mutations, which affect the catalytic domain of the protein, led to a global reduction of cytosine methylation throughout the genome. Surprisingly, the met1-2 allele, with the weaker DNA hypomethylation phenotype, alters a well-conserved residue in methyltransferase signature motif I. The stronger met1-1 allele caused late flowering and a heterochronic delay in the juvenile-to-adult rosette leaf transition. The distribution of late-flowering phenotypes in a mapping population segregating met1-1 indicates that the flowering-time phenotype is caused by the accumulation of inherited defects at loci unlinked to the met1 mutation. The delay in flowering time is due in part to the formation and inheritance of hypomethylated fwa epialleles, but inherited defects at other loci are likely to contribute as well. Centromeric repeat arrays hypomethylated in met1-1 mutants are partially remethylated when introduced into a wild-type background, in contrast to genomic sequences hypomethylated in ddm1 mutants. ddm1 met1 double mutants were constructed to further our understanding of the mechanism of DDM1 action and the interaction between two major genetic loci affecting global cytosine methylation levels in Arabidopsis.},

  Abstract                 = {The number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes can be affected by ancestral selectively favored substitutions at linked loci. The degree to which this happens depends on when in the history of the sample the selected substitutions happen, the strength of selection and the amount of crossing over between the sampled locus and the loci at which the selected substitutions occur. This phenomenon is commonly called hitchhiking. Using the coalescent process for a random sample of genes from a selectively neutral locus that is linked to a locus at which selection is taking place, a stochastic, finite population model is developed that describes the steady state effect of hitchhiking on the distribution of the number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample. A prediction of the model is that, in regions of low crossing over, strongly selected substitutions in the history of the sample can substantially reduce the number of polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes from that expected under a neutral model.},

  Abstract                 = {A putative role for mammalian polynucleotide kinases that possess both 5′-phosphotransferase and 3′-phosphatase activity is the restoration of DNA strand breaks with 5′-hydroxyl termini or 3′-phosphate termini, or both, to a form that supports the subsequent action of DNA repair polymerases and DNA ligases, i.e. 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini. To further assess this possibility, we compared the activity of the 3′-phosphatase of purified calf thymus polynucleotide kinase towards a variety of substrates. The rate of removal of 3′-phosphate groups from nicked or short (1 nt) gapped sites in double-stranded DNA was observed to be similar to that of 3′-phosphate groups from single-stranded substrates. Thus this activity of polynucleotide kinase does not appear to be influenced by steric accessibility of the phosphate group. We subsequently demonstrated that the concerted reactions of polynucleotide kinase and purified human DNA ligase I could efficiently repair DNA nicks possessing 3′-phosphate and 5′-hydroxyl termini, and similarly the combination of these two enzymes together with purified rat DNA polymerase β could seal a strand break with a 1 nt gap. With a substrate containing a nick bounded by 3′- and 5′-OH termini, the rate of gap filling by polymerase β was significantly enhanced in the presence of polynucleotide kinase and ATP, indicating the positive influence of 5′-phosphorylation. The reaction was further enhanced by addition of DNA ligase I to the reaction mixture. This is due, at least in part, to an enhancement by DNA ligase I of the rate of 5′-phosphorylation catalyzed by polynucleotide kinase.},

Five locations, four within Pamvotida Lake basin and one in Lake Paramythia, cover a total of 0.12 km2. It is strongly dependent on wet grasslands, flooded on a seasonal basis. The greatest population density is recorded in the site with the greatest diversity of dominant plant species. Ch. lacustris is estimated to have lost 85â99% of its habitat during the last 50 years due to wetland drainage. The main threat to the species survival is further habitat loss by urbanisation around Pamvotida Lake and by land conversion to agriculture in Paramythia Lake, even though both sites belong to the Natura 2000 network. The species status is Critically Endangered and it should be listed in Annex II of the Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC) as a priority species for conservation. Restoring wet grasslands, protecting them from further urbanisation and drainage, and monitoring species population are the main measures proposed for its conservation.},

  Abstract                 = {Whether chromosomal rearrangements promote speciation by providing barriers to gene exchange between populations is one of the long-standing debates in evolutionary biology. This question can be addressed by studying patterns of gene flow and selection in hybrid zones between chromosomally diverse taxa. Here we present results of the first study of the genetic structure of a hybrid zone between chromosomal races of morabine grasshoppers Vandiemenella viatica, P24(XY) and viatica17, on Kangaroo Island, Australia. Chromosomal and 11 nuclear markers revealed a narrow hybrid zone with strong linkage disequilibrium and heterozygote deficits, most likely maintained by a balance between dispersal and selection. Widths and positions of clines for these markers are concordant and coincident, suggesting that selection is unlikely to be concentrated on a few chromosomes. In contrast, a mitochondrial marker showed a significantly wider cline with centre offset toward the P24(XY) side. We argue that the discordance between the mitochondrial and nuclear/chromosomal clines and overall asymmetry of the clines suggest a secondary origin of the contact zone and potential movement of the zone after contact. Genome-wide scans using many genetic markers and chromosomal mapping of these markers are needed to investigate whether chromosomal differences directly reduce gene flow after secondary contact.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent theoretical developments have led to a renewed interest in the potential role of chromosomal rearrangements in speciation. Australian morabine grasshoppers (genus Vandiemenella, viatica species group) provide an excellent study system to test this potential role of chromosomal rearrangements because they show extensive chromosomal variation and formed the basis of a classic chromosomal speciation model. There are three chromosomal races, viatica19, viatica17, and P24(XY), on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, forming five parapatric populations with four putative contact zones among them. We investigate the extent to which chromosomal variation among these populations may be associated with barriers to gene flow. Population genetic and phylogeographical analyses using 15 variable allozyme loci and the elongation factor-1alpha (EF-1alpha) gene indicate that the three races represent genetically distinct taxa. In contrast, analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene show the presence of three distinctive and geographically localized groups that do not correspond with the distribution of the chromosomal races. These discordant population genetic patterns are likely to result from introgressive hybridization between the chromosomal races and range expansions/contractions. Overall, these results suggest that reduction of nuclear gene flow may be associated with chromosomal variation, or underlying genetic variation linked with chromosomal variation, whereas mitochondrial gene flow appears to be independent of this variation in these morabine grasshoppers. The identification of an intact contact zone between P24(XY) and viatica17 offers considerable potential for further investigation of molecular mechanisms that maintain distinct nuclear genomes among the chromosomal races.},

Recent technological developments provide a path towards detailed understanding of the genomic and molecular basis of experimental evolutionary change, while new findings raise new questions that can be addressed with this approach. However, experimental evolution has important limitations, and the interpretation of results is subject to caveats resulting from small population sizes, limited timescales, the simplified nature of laboratory environments, and, in some cases, the potential to misinterpret the selective forces and other processes at work.},

  Abstract                 = {Comparisons of the DNA sequences of metazoa show an excess of transitional over transversional substitutions. Part of this bias is due to the relatively high rate of mutation of methylated cytosines to thymine. Postmutation processes also introduce a bias, particularly selection for codon-usage bias in coding regions. It is generally assumed, however, that there is a universal bias in favour of transitions over transversions, possibly as a result of the underlying chemistry of mutation. Surprisingly, this underlying trend has been evaluated only in two types of metazoan, namely Drosophila and the Mammalia. Here, we investigate a third group, and find no such bias. We characterize the point substitution spectrum in Podisma pedestris, a grasshopper species with a very large genome. The accumulation of mutations was surveyed in two pseudogene families, nuclear mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA sequences. The cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides exhibit the high transition frequencies expected of methylated sites. The transition rate at other cytosine residues is significantly lower. After accounting for this methylation effect, there is no significant difference between transition and transversion rates. These results contrast with reports from other taxa and lead us to reject the hypothesis of a universal transition/transversion bias. Instead we suggest fundamental interspecific differences in point substitution processes.},

We report a markedly different pattern in the genome of the grasshopper Podisma pedestris. Single individuals contain several highly divergent ribosomal DNA groups. Analysis of the magnitude of divergence indicates that these groups have coexisted in the Podisma lineage for at least 11 million years. There are two putatively functional groups, each estimated to be at least 4 million years old, and several pseudogene groups, many of which are transcribed. Southern hybridization and real-time PCR experiments show that only one of the putatively functional types occurs at high copy number. However, this group is scarcely amplified under standard PCR conditions, which means that phylogenetic inference on the basis of standard PCR would be severely distorted. The analysis suggests that concerted evolution has been remarkably ineffective in P. pedestris. We propose that this outcome may be related to the species' exceptionally large genome and the associated low rate of deletion per base pair, which may allow pseudogenes to persist.},

  Abstract                 = {Adaptive radiations are an important source of biodiversity and are often characterized by many speciation events in very short succession. It has been proposed that the high speciation rates in these radiations may be fuelled by novel genetic combinations produced in episodes of hybridization among the young species. The role of such hybridization events in the evolutionary history of a group can be investigated by comparing the genealogical relationships inferred from different subsets of loci, but such studies have thus far often been hampered by shallow genetic divergences, especially in young adaptive radiations, and the lack of genome-scale molecular data. Here, we use a genome-wide sampling of SNPs identified within restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) tags to investigate the genomic consistency of patterns of shared ancestry and adaptive divergence among five sympatric cichlid species of two genera, Pundamilia and Mbipia, which form part of the massive adaptive radiation of cichlids in the East African Lake Victoria. Species pairs differ along several axes: male nuptial colouration, feeding ecology, depth distribution, as well as the morphological traits that distinguish the two genera and more subtle morphological differences. Using outlier scan approaches, we identify signals of divergent selection between all species pairs with a number of loci showing parallel patterns in replicated contrasts either between genera or between male colour types. We then create SNP subsets that we expect to be characterized to different extents by selection history and neutral processes and describe phylogenetic and population genetic patterns across these subsets. These analyses reveal very different evolutionary histories for different regions of the genome. To explain these results, we propose at least two intergeneric hybridization events (between Mbipia spp. and Pundamilia spp.) in the evolutionary history of these five species that would have lead to the evolution of novel trait combinations and new species.},

  Abstract                 = {Incompletely isolated species provide an opportunity to investigate the genetic mechanisms and evolutionary forces that maintain distinct species in the face of ongoing gene flow. Here, we use field surveys and reduced representation sequencing to characterize the patterns of reproductive isolation, admixture and genomic divergence between populations of the outcrossing wildflower Mimulus guttatus and selfing M.¬†nasutus. Focusing on a single site where these two species have come into secondary contact, we find that phenological isolation is strong, although incomplete, and is likely driven by divergence in response to photoperiod. In contrast to previous field studies, which have suggested that F1-hybrid formation might be rare, we discover patterns of genomic variation consistent with ongoing introgression. Strikingly, admixed individuals vary continuously from highly admixed to nearly pure M.¬†guttatus, demonstrating ongoing hybridization and asymmetric introgression from M.¬†nasutus into M.¬†guttatus. Patterns of admixture and divergence across the genome show that levels of introgression are more variable than expected by chance. Some genomic regions show a reduced introgression, including one region that overlaps a critical photoperiod QTL, whereas other regions show elevated levels of interspecific gene flow. In addition, we observe a genome-wide negative relationship between absolute divergence and the local recombination rate, potentially indicating natural selection against M.¬†nasutus ancestry in M.¬†guttatus genetic backgrounds. Together, our results suggest that Mimulus speciation is both ongoing and dynamic and that a combination of divergence in phenology and mating system, as well as selection against interspecific alleles, likely maintains these sympatric species.},

A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how BLAT was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. BLAT is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based BLAT server for the human genome.},

  Abstract                 = {The three closely related grasshopper species C. biguttulus, C. brunneus and C. mollis occur sympatrically over large portions of Europe. They belong to the C. biguttulus species group (Orthoptera, Acrididae) whose members have been shown to be almost exclusively isolated by the acoustic communication system of the male calling song and female preference for the conspecific song. Nevertheless, occasional breakdown of the behavioural isolation between these species still occurs, creating conspicuous hybrid populations. It is therefore assumed that strong selection is acting against the introgression of foreign song and preference genes, especially as male hybrids are behaviourally sterile. Thus, genes for mating behaviour should be distinguished from other genes by a stronger differentiation in the three species. To date, RFLP studies of the mitochondrial genome and allozyme studies have shown no genetic differentiation among any member of the C. biguttulus species group. For this reason, I investigated the genetic divergence of the three grasshopper species at a candidate gene locus for mating behaviour (cacophony) as well as at two housekeeping genes (aconitase and tropomyosin).
As opposed to the housekeeping genes, the candidate gene cacophony shows a strong and significant differentiation between C. biguttulus and C. brunneus (Nei's D: 1.97, p<0.001). Even though all mutations in the 892 analysed base pairs of the cacophony mRNA coding sequence are silent (i. e. synonymous), the extremely low nucleotide diversity (?T: 0.001) suggests strong selection at genetically linked loci (e.g. regulatory sequences of cacophony). Moreover, a comparison of sequences from males and females strongly suggests an X-chromosomal location of cacophony in the studied grasshopper species. The housekeeping gene aconitase shows a strong and significant differentiation of C. mollis against the other two species (FCT: 0.46, 95% CI above 0.36) and only a minor differentiation of C. biguttulus and C. brunneus (FCT: 0.076, 95% CI above 0.045). The housekeeping gene tropomyosin only weakly differentiates C. mollis from the two other species (FCT: 0.065, 95% CI above 0.021).
Along with the recently published fruitless gene, cacophony and aconitase are the first significantly differentiated loci to be found in the C. biguttulus species group. No geographic structuring of the genetic variation at the three investigated loci could be detected. Furthermore, I found no significant deviation from neutral evolution at the aconitase locus in the three species (Tajima's D test), qualifying aconitase as a neutral marker for further genetic studies in the C. biguttulus species group.},

  Abstract                 = {Colour polymorphism is known to facilitate speciation but the genetic basis of animal pigmentation and how colour polymorphisms contribute to speciation is poorly understood. Restricted recombination may promote linkage disequilibrium between the colour locus and incompatibility genes. Genomic rearrangement and the position of relevant loci within a chromosome are important factors that influence the frequency of recombination. Therefore, it is important to know the position of the colour locus, gene order and recombination landscape of the chromosome to understand the mechanism that generates incompatibilities between morphs. Recent studies showed remarkable pre- and postzygotic incompatibilities between sympatric colour morphs of the Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae), in which head feather colour is genetically determined by a single sex-linked locus, Red. We constructed a genetic map for the Z chromosome of the Gouldian finch (male-specific map distance=131[thinsp]cM), using 618 captive-bred birds and 34 microsatellite markers, to investigate the extent of inter- and intraspecific genomic rearrangements and variation in recombination rate within the Z chromosome. We refined the location of the Red locus to a ~7.2-cM interval in a region with a moderate recombination rate but outside the least-recombining, putative centromeric region. There was no evidence of chromosome-wide genomic rearrangements between the chromosomes carrying the red or black alleles with the current marker resolution. This work will contribute to identifying the causal gene, which will in turn enable alternative explanations for the association between incompatibility and colouration, such as fine-scale linkage disequilibrium, genomic rearrangements and pleiotropy, to be tested.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic architecture may profoundly influence the ability of adaptive traits to spread between species via introgressive hybridization. Here, we examine the genomic location of quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with pollen sterility and morphological traits distinguishing two annual sunflowers, Helianthus annuus and H. debilis ssp. cucumerifolius. These species are of particular interest since they hybridize naturally, and the form of H. annuus in Texas (called ssp. texanus) is thought to have arisen through introgression. Analysis of 226 BC(1) progeny from a cross between H. annuus and H. debilis revealed 56 QTL for 15 morphological traits and 2 QTL for pollen sterility. Four morphological QTL are tightly linked (<10 cM) to one or more sterility factors and 7 are closely allied with underrepresented and presumably negatively selected chromosomal blocks. Although these 11 QTL seem unlikely to move between the species, no barrier to introgression was detected for the remaining 45 morphological QTL. In fact, due to widespread pleiotropy (or tight linkage), the introgression of just three small chromosomal blocks appears sufficient to largely recover the phenotype of ssp. texanus. Subsequent work will test for the occurrence and fitness consequences of the identified QTL in natural populations of ssp. texanus.},

  Abstract                 = {Most common hereditary diseases in humans are complex and multifactorial. Large-scale genome-wide association studies based on SNP genotyping have only identified a small fraction of the heritable variation of these diseases. One explanation may be that many rare variants (a minor allele frequency, MAF <5\%), which are not included in the common genotyping platforms, may contribute substantially to the genetic variation of these diseases. Next-generation sequencing, which would allow the analysis of rare variants, is now becoming so cheap that it provides a viable alternative to SNP genotyping. In this paper, we present cost-effective protocols for using next-generation sequencing in association mapping studies based on pooled and un-pooled samples, and identify optimal designs with respect to total number of individuals, number of individuals per pool, and the sequencing coverage. We perform a small empirical study to evaluate the pooling variance in a realistic setting where pooling is combined with exon-capturing. To test for associations, we develop a likelihood ratio statistic that accounts for the high error rate of next-generation sequencing data. We also perform extensive simulations to determine the power and accuracy of this method. Overall, our findings suggest that with a fixed cost, sequencing many individuals at a more shallow depth with larger pool size achieves higher power than sequencing a small number of individuals in higher depth with smaller pool size, even in the presence of high error rates. Our results provide guidelines for researchers who are developing association mapping studies based on next-generation sequencing.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimation of allele frequency is of fundamental importance in population genetic analyses and in association mapping. In most studies using next-generation sequencing, a cost effective approach is to use medium or low-coverage data (e.g., < 15X). However, SNP calling and allele frequency estimation in such studies is associated with substantial statistical uncertainty because of varying coverage and high error rates.We evaluate a new maximum likelihood method for estimating allele frequencies in low and medium coverage next-generation sequencing data. The method is based on integrating over uncertainty in the data for each individual rather than first calling genotypes. This method can be applied to directly test for associations in case/control studies. We use simulations to compare the likelihood method to methods based on genotype calling, and show that the likelihood method outperforms the genotype calling methods in terms of: (1) accuracy of allele frequency estimation, (2) accuracy of the estimation of the distribution of allele frequencies across neutrally evolving sites, and (3) statistical power in association mapping studies. Using real re-sequencing data from 200 individuals obtained from an exon-capture experiment, we show that the patterns observed in the simulations are also found in real data.Overall, our results suggest that association mapping and estimation of allele frequencies should not be based on genotype calling in low to medium coverage data. Furthermore, if genotype calling methods are used, it is usually better not to filter genotypes based on the call confidence score.},

Recent theoretical studies have attempted to quantify the speed of adaptation under the Fisher-Muller model, partly in an attempt to understand the role of "clonal interference" in microbial experimental evolution. We reexamine adaptation in sexuals vs. asexuals, using a model of DNA sequence evolution. In this model, a modest number of sites can mutate to beneficial alleles and the fitness effects of these mutations are unequal. We study (1) transition probabilities to different beneficial mutations; (2) waiting times to the first and the last substitutions of beneficial mutations; and (3) trajectories of mean fitness through time. We find that some of these statistics are surprisingly similar between sexuals and asexuals. These results highlight the importance of the choice of substitution model in assessing the Fisher-Muller advantage of sex.},

We analyze this interaction of directional selection and background selection and study their combined effects on neutral variation, using a three-locus model in which each locus is subjected to either deleterious, favorable, or neutral mutations. Average heterozygosity is measured by simulations (1) at the stationary state under the assumption of recurrent hitchhiking events and (2) as a transient level after a single hitchhiking event. The simulation results are compared to theoretical predictions. It is shown that known analytical solutions describing the hitchhiking effect without background selection can be modified such that they accurately predict the joint effects of hitchhiking and background on linked, neutral variation. Generalization of these results to a more appropriate multilocus model (such that background selection can occur at multiple sites) suggests that, in regions of very low recombination rates, stationary levels of nucleotide diversity are primarily determined by hitchhiking, whereas in regions of high recombination, background selection is the dominant force. The implications of these results on the identification and estimation of the relevant parameters of the model are discussed.},

future studies of selection in the wild. First, we review past analyses of the patterns of
directional selection. We present new meta-analyses that confirm differences in the
direction and magnitude of selection for different types of traits and fitness components.
Second, we describe patterns of temporal and spatial variation in directional selection, and
their implications for cumulative selection and directional evolution. Meta-analyses sug-
gest that sampling error contributes importantly to observed temporal variation in selec-
tion, and indicate that evidence for frequent temporal changes in the direction of selection
in natural populations is limited. Third, we review the apparent lack of evidence for
widespread stabilizing selection, and discuss biological and methodological explanations
for this pattern. Finally, we describe how sampling error, statistical biases, choice of traits,
fitness measures and selection metrics, environmental covariance and other factors may
limit the inferences we can draw from analyses of selection coefficients. Current tandardized selection metrics based on simple parametric statistical models may be
inadequate for understanding patterns of non-linear selection and complex fitness surfaces.
We highlight three promising areas for expanding our understanding of selection in the
wild: (1) field studies of stabilizing selection, selection on physiological and behavioral
traits, and the ecological causes of selection; (2) new statistical models and methods that
connect phenotypic variation to population demography and selection; and (3) availability
of the underlying individual-level data sets from past and future selection studies, which
will allow comprehensive modeling of selection and fitness variation within and across
systems, rather than meta-analyses of standardized selection metrics.},

  Abstract                 = {How strong is phenotypic selection on quantitative traits in the wild? We reviewed the literature from 1984 through 1997 for studies that estimated the strength of linear and quadratic selection in terms of standardized selection gradients or differentials on natural variation in quantitative traits for field populations. We tabulated 63 published studies of 62 species that reported over 2,500 estimates of linear or quadratic selection. More than 80\% of the estimates were for morphological traits; there is very little data for behavioral or physiological traits. Most published selection studies were unreplicated and had sample sizes below 135 individuals, resulting in low statistical power to detect selection of the magnitude typically reported for natural populations. The absolute values of linear selection gradients |beta| were exponentially distributed with an overall median of 0.16, suggesting that strong directional selection was uncommon. The values of |beta| for selection on morphological and on life-history/phenological traits were significantly different: on average, selection on morphology was stronger than selection on phenology/life history. Similarly, the values of |beta| for selection via aspects of survival, fecundity, and mating success were significantly different: on average, selection on mating success was stronger than on survival. Comparisons of estimated linear selection gradients and differentials suggest that indirect components of phenotypic selection were usually modest relative to direct components. The absolute values of quadratic selection gradients |gamma| were exponentially distributed with an overall median of only 0.10, suggesting that quadratic selection is typically quite weak. The distribution of gamma values was symmetric about 0, providing no evidence that stabilizing selection is stronger or more common than disruptive selection in nature.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to the increasing throughput of current DNA sequencing instruments, sample multiplexing is necessary for making economical use of available sequencing capacities. A widely used multiplexing strategy for the Illumina Genome Analyzer utilizes sample-specific indexes, which are embedded in one of the library adapters. However, this and similar multiplex approaches come with a risk of sample misidentification. By introducing indexes into both library adapters (double indexing), we have developed a method that reveals the rate of sample misidentification within current multiplex sequencing experiments. With â¼0.3% these rates are orders of magnitude higher than expected and may severely confound applications in cancer genomics and other fields requiring accurate detection of rare variants. We identified the occurrence of mixed clusters on the flow as the predominant source of error. The accuracy of sample identification is further impaired if indexed oligonucleotides are cross-contaminated or if indexed libraries are amplified in bulk. Double-indexing eliminates these problems and increases both the scope and accuracy of multiplex sequencing on the Illumina platform.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the evolution of inversions that capture locally adapted alleles when two populations are exchanging migrants or hybridizing. By suppressing recombination between the loci, a new inversion can spread. Neither drift nor coadaptation between the alleles (epistasis) is needed, so this local adaptation mechanism may apply to a broader range of genetic and demographic situations than alternative hypotheses that have been widely discussed. The mechanism can explain many features observed in inversion systems. It will drive an inversion to high frequency if there is no countervailing force, which could explain fixed differences observed between populations and species. An inversion can be stabilized at an intermediate frequency if it also happens to capture one or more deleterious recessive mutations, which could explain polymorphisms that are common in some species. This polymorphism can cycle in frequency with the changing selective advantage of the locally favored alleles. The mechanism can establish underdominant inversions that decrease heterokaryotype fitness by several percent if the cause of fitness loss is structural, while if the cause is genic there is no limit to the strength of underdominance that can result. The mechanism is expected to cause loci responsible for adaptive species-specific differences to map to inversions, as seen in recent QTL studies. We discuss data that support the hypothesis, review other mechanisms for inversion evolution, and suggest possible tests.},

Under some kinds of sex linkage (e.g. Z-linked preferences), a runaway is more likely than under autosomal inheritance, while under others (e.g., X-linked preferences and autosomal displays), the good-genes mechanism is particularly powerful.

Males have much higher mutation rates than females in several vertebrate and plant taxa. When evolutionary rates are limited by the supply of favorable new mutations, then genes will evolve faster when located on sex chromosomes that spend more time in males. For mutations with additive effects, Y-linked genes evolve fastest, followed by Z-linked genes, autosomal genes, X-linked genes, and finally W-linked and cytoplasmic genes. This ordering can change when mutations show dominance. The predicted differences in substitution rates may be detectable at the molecular level. Male-biased mutation could cause adaptive changes to accumulate more readily on certain kinds of chromosomes and favor animals with Z-W sex determination to have rapidly evolving male sexual displays.},

This article attempts to unify this literature by identifying five major elements that determine the outcome of speciation caused by selection: a form of disruptive selection, a form of isolating mechanism (assortment or a mating preference), a way to transmit the force of disruptive selection to the isolating mechanism (direct selection or indirect selection), a genetic basis for increased isolation (a one- or two-allele mechanism), and an initial condition (high or low initial divergence). We show that the geographical context of speciation (allopatry vs. sympatry) can be viewed as a form of assortative mating. These five elements appear to operate largely independently of each other and can be used to make generalizations about when speciation is most likely to happen. This provides a framework for interpreting results from laboratory experiments, which are found to agree generally with theoretical predictions about conditions that are favorable to the evolution of prezygotic isolation.},

A difference between the mean display trait on the continent and on the island is sufficient to drive reinforcement of preferences. Additional postzygotic isolation, caused, for example, by either epistatic incompatibility or ecological selection against hybrids, will amplify reinforcement but is not necessary. Under some conditions, the degree of preference reinforcement is a simple function of quantities that can be estimated entirely from phenotypic data. We go on to study how postzygotic isolation caused by epistatic incompatibilities affects reinforcement of the preference. With only one pair of epistatic loci, reinforcement is enhanced by tighter linkage between the preference genes and the genes causing hybrid incompatibility. Reinforcement of the preference is also affected by the number of epistatically interacting genes involved in incompatibility, independent of the overall intensity of selection against hybrids.},

  Abstract                 = {The cellular energy produced by mitochondria is a fundamental currency of life. However, the extent to which mitochondrial (mt) performance (power and endurance) is adapted to habitats and life strategies of vertebrates is not well understood. A global analysis of mt genomes revealed that hydrophobicity (HYD) of mt membrane proteins (MMPs) is much lower in terrestrial vertebrates than in fishes and shows a strong negative correlation with serine/threonine composition (STC). Here, we present evidence that this systematic feature of MMPs was crucial for the evolution of large terrestrial vertebrates with high aerobic capacity. An Arrhenius-type equation gave positive correlations between STC and maximum life span (MLS) in terrestrial vertebrates (with a few exceptions relating to the lifestyle of small animals with a high resting metabolic rate [RMR]) and negative correlations in secondary marine vertebrates, such as cetaceans and alligators (which returned from land to water, utilizing buoyancy with increased body size). In particular, marked STC increases in primates (especially hominoids) among placentals were associated with very high MLS values. We connected these STC increases in MMPs with greater stability of respiratory complexes by estimating the degradation of the Arrhenius plot given by accelerating mtRMR up to mt maximum metabolic rate. Both mtRMR and HYD in terrestrial vertebrates decreased with increasing body mass. Decreases in mtRMR raise MMP stability when high mobility is not required, whereas decreased HYD may weaken this stability under the hydrophobic environment of lipid bilayer. High maximal metabolic rates (5-10 RMR), which we postulate require high MMP mobility, presumably render MMPs more unstable. A marked rise in STC may therefore be essential to stabilize MMPs, perhaps as dynamic supercomplexes, via hydrogen bonds associated with serine/threonine motifs.},

  Abstract                 = {Next generation sequencing technologies often require numerous primer designs that require good target coverage that can be financially costly. We aimed to develop a system that would implement primer reuse to design degenerate primers that could be designed around SNPs, thus find the fewest necessary primers and the lowest cost whilst maintaining an acceptable coverage and provide a cost effective solution. We have implemented Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo for optimizing primer reuse. We call it the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Optimized Degenerate Primer Reuse (MCMC-ODPR) algorithm.After repeating the program 1020 times to assess the variance, an average of 17.14\% fewer primers were found to be necessary using MCMC-ODPR for an equivalent coverage without implementing primer reuse. The algorithm was able to reuse primers up to five times. We compared MCMC-ODPR with single sequence primer design programs Primer3 and Primer-BLAST and achieved a lower primer cost per amplicon base covered of 0.21 and 0.19 and 0.18 primer nucleotides on three separate gene sequences, respectively. With multiple sequences, MCMC-ODPR achieved a lower cost per base covered of 0.19 than programs BatchPrimer3 and PAMPS, which achieved 0.25 and 0.64 primer nucleotides, respectively.MCMC-ODPR is a useful tool for designing primers at various melting temperatures at good target coverage. By combining degeneracy with optimal primer reuse the user may increase coverage of sequences amplified by the designed primers at significantly lower costs. Our analyses showed that overall MCMC-ODPR outperformed the other primer-design programs in our study in terms of cost per covered base.},

Although individual human genome sequencing is increasingly routine, nearly all such genomes are unresolved with respect to haplotype. Here we combine the throughput of massively parallel sequencing with the contiguity information provided by large-insert cloning to experimentally determine the haplotype-resolved genome of a South Asian individual. A single fosmid library was split into a modest number of pools, each providing ∼3\% physical coverage of the diploid genome. Sequencing of each pool yielded reads overwhelmingly derived from only one homologous chromosome at any given location. These data were combined with whole-genome shotgun sequence to directly phase 94\% of ascertained heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) into long haplotype blocks (N50 of 386 kilobases (kbp)). This method also facilitates the analysis of structural variation, for example, to anchor novel insertions to specific locations and haplotypes.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic variability among males is a necessary precondition for the evolution of female choice based on indirect genetic benefits. In addition to mutations and host-parasite cycles, migration of locally adapted individuals offers an explanation for the maintenance of genetic variability. In a previous study, conducting a reciprocal transplant experiment on a grasshopper, Chorthippus biguttulus, we found that environmental conditions significantly influenced not only body condition but also an important trait of male calling song, the amplitude of song. Although not significant, all other analysed physical and courtship song traits and attractiveness were superior in native than in transferred males. Thus, we concluded that local adaptation has a slight but consistent influence on a range of traits in our study populations, including male acoustic attractiveness. In our present study, we scanned male grasshoppers from the same two populations for amplification fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci connected with acoustic attractiveness to conspecific females. We found greater differences in allele frequencies between the two populations, for some loci, than are expected from a balance between drift and gene flow. These loci are potentially connected with locally adapted traits. We examined whether these alleles show the proposed genotype environment interaction by having different associations with attractiveness in the two populations. One locus was significantly related to sexual attractiveness; however, this was independent of the males' population affiliation. Future research on the evolution of female choice will benefit from knowledge of the underlying genetic architecture of male traits under intraspecific sexual selection, and the 'population genomics' approach can be a powerful tool for revealing this structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Male courtship songs have two functions in species recognition and intraspecific mate choice. Female preference might thus exert different types of selection pressure on male song traits. We used a combination of acoustic mate choice experiments and statistical analyses to examine how traits of the calling songs of male nightingale grasshoppers,Chorthippus biguttulus , are influenced by different sexual selection pressures. We recorded calling songs of males and tested their attractiveness to females in acoustic mate choice experiments. The attractiveness values were a good estimate of the potential male mating success. In experiments with a pair of males, females copulated significantly more often with the male that had the higher attractiveness value. To detect directional, stabilizing, disruptive or correlative selection acting on male song properties we used linear and nonlinear regressions between male song traits and female response behaviour. Three signal traits were revealed to be under directional selection: song loudness, pause to syllable ratio and the mean duration of gaps within syllables. A nonlinear regression testing for correlative selection showed that a fourth song trait, rhythm, in combination with mean gap duration was also important for female mate choice. With these traits and trait combinations we were able to explain 42% of the variance in attractiveness between males. Since we found no evidence for stabilizing selection, but ample evidence for directional selection, we conclude that selection on the traits examined is related to mate choice mainly in the context of intraspecific sexual selection and probably less so in species recognition.

Here we show that a phylogenetic correlation is observed between chaetodactylid mites and their hosts, the long-tongued bees; however, this association manifests itself in an atypical fashion. Recently derived mites tend to be associated with basal bee lineages, and vice versa, ruling out a process of cospeciation, and the existence of mites on multiple hosts also suggests ample opportunity for host shifts. An extensive survey of museum collections reveals a pattern of infrequent host shifts at a higher taxonomic level, and yet, frequent shifts at a lower level, which suggests that ecological constraints structure the coevolutionary history of the mites and bees. Certain bee traits, particularly aspects of their nesting behavior, provide a highly predictive framework for the observed pattern of host use, with 82.1\% of taxa correctly classified. Thus, the museum survey and phylogenetic analyses provide a unique window into the central role ecology plays in this coevolutionary association. This role is apparent from two different perspectives--as (a) a constraining force evident in the historical processes underlying the significant correlation between the mite and bee phylogenies, as well as (b) by the highly nonrandom composition of bee taxa that serve as hosts to chaetodactylid mites.},

This contradiction between performance and popularity is even more perplexing given the recent methodological and computational advances for making historical inferences, which include estimating population genetic parameters and testing different biogeographic scenarios. Here I briefly review the history of criticisms and rebuttals that focus specifically on the high rate of incorrect phylogeographic inference of nested-clade analysis, with the goal of understanding what drives its unfettered popularity. In this case, the appeal of what nested-clade analysis claims to do--not what the method actually achieves--appears to explain its paradoxical status as a favorite method that fails. What a method promises, as opposed to how it performs, must be considered separately when evaluating whether the method represents a valuable tool for historical inference.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic data are frequently used to delimit species, where species status is determined on the basis of an exclusivity criterium, such as reciprocal monophyly. Not only are there numerous empirical examples of incongruence between the boundaries inferred from such data compared to other sources like morphology -- especially with recently derived species, but population genetic theory also clearly shows that an inevitable bias in species status results because genetic thresholds do not explicitly take into account how the timing of speciation influences patterns of genetic differentiation. This study represents a fundamental shift in how genetic data might be used to delimit species. Rather than equating gene trees with a species tree or basing species status on some genetic threshold, the relationship between the gene trees and the species history is modeled probabilistically. Here we show that the same theory that is used to calculate the probability of reciprocal monophyly can also be used to delimit species despite widespread incomplete lineage sorting. The results from a preliminary simulation study suggest that very recently derived species can be accurately identified long before the requisite time for reciprocal monophyly to be achieved following speciation. The study also indicates the importance of sampling, both with regards to loci and individuals. Withstanding a thorough investigation into the conditions under which the coalescent-based approach will be effective, namely how the timing of divergence relative to the effective population size of species affects accurate species delimitation, the results are nevertheless consistent with other recent studies (aimed at inferring species relationships), showing that despite the lack of monophyletic gene trees, a signal of species divergence persists and can be extracted. Using an explicit model-based approach also avoids two primary problems with species delimitation that result when genetic thresholds are applied with genetic data -- the inherent biases in species detection arising from when and how speciation occurred, and failure to take into account the high stochastic variance of genetic processes. Both the utility and sensitivities of the coalescent-based approach outlined here are discussed; most notably, a model-based approach is essential for determining whether incompletely sorted gene lineages are (or are not) consistent with separate species lineages, and such inferences require accurate model parameterization (i.e., a range of realistic effective population sizes relative to potential times of divergence for the purported species). It is the goal (and motivation of this study) that genetic data might be used effectively as a source of complementation to other sources of data for diagnosing species, as opposed to the exclusion of other evidence for species delimitation, which will require an explicit consideration of the effects of the temporal dynamic of lineage splitting on genetic data.},

  Abstract                 = {Patterns of genetic variation can provide valuable insights for deciphering the relative roles of different evolutionary processes in species differentiation. However, population-genetic models for studying divergence in geographically structured species are generally lacking. Since these are the biogeographic settings where genetic drift is expected to predominate, not only are population-genetic tests of hypotheses in geographically structured species constrained, but generalizations about the evolutionary processes that promote species divergence may also be potentially biased. Here we estimate a population-divergence model in montane grasshoppers from the sky islands of the Rocky Mountains. Because this region was directly impacted by Pleistocene glaciation, both the displacement into glacial refugia and recolonization of montane habitats may contribute to differentiation. Building on the tradition of using information from the genealogical relationships of alleles to infer the geography of divergence, here the additional consideration of the process of gene-lineage sorting is used to obtain a quantitative estimate of population relationships and historical associations (i.e., a population tree) from the gene trees of five anonymous nuclear loci and one mitochondrial locus in the broadly distributed species Melanoplus oregonensis. Three different approaches are used to estimate a model of population divergence; this comparison allows us to evaluate specific methodological assumptions that influence the estimated history of divergence. A model of population divergence was identified that significantly fits the data better compared to the other approaches, based on per-site likelihood scores of the multiple loci, and that provides clues about how divergence proceeded in M. oregonensis during the dynamic Pleistocene. Unlike the approaches that either considered only the most recent coalescence (i.e., information from a single individual per population) or did not consider the pattern of coalescence in the gene genealogies, the population-divergence model that best fits the data was estimated by considering the pattern of gene lineage coalescence across multiple individuals, as well as loci. These results indicate that sampling of multiple individuals per population is critical to obtaining an accurate estimate of the history of divergence so that the signal of common ancestry can be separated from the confounding influence of gene flow-even though estimates suggest that gene flow is not a predominant factor structuring patterns of genetic variation across these sky island populations. They also suggest that the gene genealogies contain information about population relationships, despite the lack of complete sorting of gene lineages. What emerges from the analyses is a model of population divergence that incorporates both contemporary distributions and historical associations, and shows a latitudinal and regional structuring of populations reminiscent of population displacements into multiple glacial refugia. Because the population-divergence model itself is built upon the specific events shaping the history of M. oregonensis, it provides a framework for estimating additional population-genetic parameters relevant to understanding the processes governing differentiation in geographically structured species and avoids the problems of relying on overly simplified and inaccurate divergence models. The utility of these approaches, as well as the caveats and future improvements, for estimating population relationships and historical associations relevant to genetic analyses of geographically structured species are discussed.},

Depending on the historical distribution of species, genetic differences may accumulate among ancestral source populations, but there is long-standing debate whether displacements into glacial refugia promoted divergence. Here we integrate coalescent-based genetic models [3, 4] with ecological-niche modeling [5, 6] to generate expectations for patterns of genetic variation based on an inferred past distribution of a species. Reconstruction of the distribution of a montane grasshopper species during the last glacial maximum suggests that Melanoplus marshalli populations from the sky islands of Colorado and Utah were likely colonized from multiple ancestral source populations. The genetic analyses provide compelling evidence that the historical distribution of M. marshalli-namely, spatial separation of multiple refugia-was conducive to genetic differentiation. The coupling of genetic and ecological-niche modeling provides a new and flexible tool for integrating paleoenvironmental details into species-specific predictions of population structure that can increase our understanding of why the glacial cycles promoted speciation in some taxa and yet inhibited diversification in others [7, 8].},

Methods for parameter estimation are now commonly used to make inferences about demographic past. Although these approaches are well developed statistically, they typically pay little attention to geographical history. In contrast, methods that seek to reconstruct phylogeographic history are able to consider many alternative geographical scenarios, but are primarily nonstatistical, making inferences about particular biological processes without explicit reference to stochastically derived expectations. We advocate the merging of these two traditions so that statistical phylogeographic methods can provide an accurate representation of the past, consider a diverse array of processes, and yet yield a statistical estimate of that history. We discuss various conceptual issues associated with statistical phylogeographic inferences, considering especially the stochasticity of population genetic processes and assessing the confidence of phylogeographic conclusions. To this end, we present some empirical examples that utilize a statistical phylogeographic approach, and then by contrasting results from a coalescent-based approach to those from Templeton's nested cladistic analysis (NCA), we illustrate the importance of assessing error. Because NCA does not assess error in its inferences about historical processes or contemporary gene flow, we performed a small-scale study using simulated data to examine how our conclusions might be affected by such unconsidered errors. NCA did not identify the processes used to simulate the data, confusing among deterministic processes and the stochastic sorting of gene lineages. There is as yet insufficient justification of NCA's ability to accurately infer or distinguish among alternative processes. We close with a discussion of some unresolved problems of current statistical phylogeographic methods to propose areas in need of future development.},

  Abstract                 = {Determining what factors affect the structuring of genetic variation is key to deciphering the relative roles of different evolutionary processes in species differentiation. Such information is especially critical to understanding how the frequent shifts and fragmentation of species distributions during the Pleistocene translates into species differences, and why the effect of such rapid climate change on patterns of species diversity varies among taxa. Studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have detected significant population structure in many species, including those directly impacted by the glacial cycles. Yet, understanding the ultimate consequence of such structure, as it relates to how species divergence occurs, requires demonstration that such patterns are also shared with genomic patterns of differentiation. Here we present analyses of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) in the montane grasshopper Melanoplus oregonensis to assess the evolutionary significance of past demographic events and associated drift-induced divergence as inferred from mtDNA. As an inhabitant of the sky islands of the northern Rocky Mountains, this species was subject to repeated and frequent shifts in species distribution in response to the many glacial cycles. Nevertheless, significant genetic structuring of M. oregonensis is evident at two different geographic and temporal scales: recent divergence associated with the recolonization of the montane meadows in individual sky islands, as well as older divergence associated with displacements into regional glacial refugia. The genomic analyses indicate that drift-induced divergence, despite the lack of long-standing geographic barriers, has significantly contributed to species divergence during the Pleistocene. Moreover, the finding that divergence associated with past demographic events involves the repartitioning of ancestral variation without significant reductions of genomic diversity has intriguing implications - namely, the further amplification of drift-induced divergence by selection.},

Here, we study base composition evolution within the X chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster and five of its close relatives. Substitutions were inferred on six extant and two ancestral lineages for 14 near-telomeric and 9 nontelomeric genes. GC content evolution is highly variable both within the genome and within the phylogenetic tree. In the lineages leading to D. yakuba and D. orena, GC content at silent sites has increased rapidly near telomeres, but has decreased in more proximal (nontelomeric) regions. D. orena shows a 17-fold excess of GC-increasing vs. AT-increasing synonymous changes within a small (approximately 130-kb) region close to the telomeric end. Base composition changes within introns are consistent with changes in mutation patterns, but stronger GC elevation at synonymous sites suggests contributions of natural selection or biased gene conversion. The Drosophila yakuba lineage shows a less extreme elevation of GC content distributed over a wider genetic region (approximately 1.2 Mb). A lack of change in GC content for most introns within this region suggests a role of natural selection in localized base composition fluctuations.},

We argue that species lacking chromosomal sex determination, such as haplodiploids, also follow Haldane's rule and thus should be included in the definition of this rule. We provide evidence for Haldane's rule in Nasonia wasps and describe how haplodiploids can be used to test the different theories that have been proposed to explain Haldane's rule. We discuss how the faster-male and faster-X theories can shape speciation differently in haplodiploids compared to diploids.},

PoPoolation2 implements a range of commonly used measures of differentiation (F(ST), Fisher's exact test and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test) that can be applied on different scales (windows, genes, exons, SNPs).

  Abstract                 = {We consider a population that adapts to a gradually changing environment. Our aim is to describe how ecological and genetic factors combine to determine the genetic basis of adaptation. Specifically, we consider the evolution of a polygenic trait that is under stabilizing selection with a moving optimum. The ecological dynamics are defined by the strength of selection, sigma, and the speed of the optimum, v; the key genetic parameters are the mutation rate Theta and the variance of the effects of new mutations, omega. We develop analytical approximations within an "adaptive-walk" framework and describe how selection acts as a sieve that transforms a given distribution of new mutations into the distribution of adaptive substitutions. Our analytical results are complemented by individual-based simulations. We find that (i) the ecological dynamics have a strong effect on the distribution of adaptive substitutions and their impact depends largely on a single composite measure gamma=v/(sigmaThetaomega(3)), which combines the ecological and genetic parameters; (ii) depending on gamma, we can distinguish two distinct adaptive regimes: for large gamma the adaptive process is mutation limited and dominated by genetic constraints, whereas for small gamma it is environmentally limited and dominated by the external ecological dynamics; (iii) deviations from the adaptive-walk approximation occur for large mutation rates, when different mutant alleles interact via linkage or epistasis; and (iv) in contrast to predictions from previous models assuming constant selection, the distribution of adaptive substitutions is generally not exponential.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the genetic basis of adaptation in a moving optimum model, in which the optimal value for a quantitative trait increases over time at a constant rate. We first analyze a one-locus two-allele model with recurrent mutation, for which we derive accurate analytical approximations for (i) the time at which a previously deleterious allele becomes beneficial, (ii) the waiting time for a successful new mutation, and (iii) the time the mutant allele needs to reach fixation. On the basis of these results, we show that the shortest total time to fixation is for alleles with intermediate phenotypic effect. We derive an approximation for this "optimal" effect, and we show that it depends in a simple way on a composite parameter, which integrates the ecological parameters and the genetic architecture of the trait. In a second step, we use stochastic computer simulations of a multilocus model to study the order in which mutant alleles with different effects go to fixation. In agreement with the one-locus results, alleles with intermediate effect tend to become fixed earlier than those with either small or large effects. However, the effect size of the fastest mutations differs from the one predicted in the one-locus model. We show how these differences can be explained by two specific effects of multilocus genetics. Finally, we discuss our results in the light of three relevant timescales acting in the system-the environmental, mutation, and fixation timescales-which define three parameter regimes leading to qualitative differences in the adaptive substitution pattern.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a model to analyze a quantitative trait under frequency-dependent disruptive selection. Selection on the trait is a combination of stabilizing selection and intraspecific competition, where competition is maximal between individuals with equal phenotypes. In addition, there is a density-dependent component induced by population regulation. The trait is determined additively by a number of biallelic loci, which can have different effects on the trait value. In contrast to most previous models, we assume that the allelic effects at the loci can evolve due to epistatic interactions with the genetic background. Using a modifier approach, we derive analytical results under the assumption of weak selection and constant population size, and we investigate the full model by numerical simulations. We find that frequency-dependent disruptive selection favors the evolution of a highly asymmetric genetic architecture, where most of the genetic variation is concentrated on a small number of loci. We show that the evolution of genetic architecture can be understood in terms of the ecological niches created by competition. The phenotypic distribution of a population with an adapted genetic architecture closely matches this niche structure. Thus, evolution of the genetic architecture seems to be a plausible way for populations to adapt to regimes of frequency-dependent disruptive selection. As such, it should be seen as a potential evolutionary pathway to discrete polymorphisms and as a potential alternative to other evolutionary responses, such as the evolution of sexual dimorphism or assortative mating.},

  Abstract                 = {Long-read single-molecule sequencing has revolutionized de novo genome assembly and enabled the automated reconstruction of reference-quality genomes. However, given the relatively high error rates of such technologies, efficient and accurate assembly of large repeats and closely related haplotypes remains challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a complete reworking of Celera Assembler that is specifically designed for noisy single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support for nanopore sequencing, halves depth-of-coverage requirements, and improves assembly continuity while simultaneously reducing runtime by an order of magnitude on large genomes. These advances result from new overlapping and assembly algorithms, including an adaptive overlapping strategy based on tf-idf weighted MinHash and a sparse assembly graph construction that avoids collapsing diverged repeats and haplotypes. We demonstrate that Canu can reliably assemble complete microbial genomes and near-complete eukaryotic chromosomes using either PacBio or Oxford Nanopore technologies, and achieves a contig NG50 of greater than 21 Mbp on both human and Drosophila melanogaster PacBio datasets. For assembly structures that cannot be linearly represented, Canu provides graph-based assembly outputs for analysis or integration with complementary phasing and scaffolding techniques.

These statistics are now often being applied in the analysis of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. However, estimates of frequency spectra from NGS data are strongly affected by low sequencing coverage; the inherent technology dependent variation in sequencing depth causes systematic differences in the value of the statistic among genomic regions.We have developed an approach that accommodates the uncertainty of the data when calculating site frequency based neutrality test statistics. A salient feature of this approach is that it implicitly solves the problems of varying sequencing depth, missing data and avoids the need to infer variable sites for the analysis and thereby avoids ascertainment problems introduced by a SNP discovery process.Using an empirical Bayes approach for fast computations, we show that this method produces results for low-coverage NGS data comparable to those achieved when the genotypes are known without uncertainty. We also validate the method in an analysis of data from the 1000 genomes project. The method is implemented in a fast framework which enables researchers to perform these neutrality tests on a genome-wide scale.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate identification of DNA polymorphisms using next-generation sequencing technology is challenging because of a high rate of sequencing error and incorrect mapping of reads to reference genomes. Currently available short read aligners and DNA variant callers suffer from these problems. We developed the Coval software to improve the quality of short read alignments. Coval is designed to minimize the incidence of spurious alignment of short reads, by filtering mismatched reads that remained in alignments after local realignment and error correction of mismatched reads. The error correction is executed based on the base quality and allele frequency at the non-reference positions for an individual or pooled sample. We demonstrated the utility of Coval by applying it to simulated genomes and experimentally obtained short-read data of rice, nematode, and mouse. Moreover, we found an unexpectedly large number of incorrectly mapped reads in 'targeted' alignments, where the whole genome sequencing reads had been aligned to a local genomic segment, and showed that Coval effectively eliminated such spurious alignments. We conclude that Coval significantly improves the quality of short-read sequence alignments, thereby increasing the calling accuracy of currently available tools for SNP and indel identification. Coval is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/coval105/.},

We give an overview of the available information on fish shoals and assess to what degree the predictions made from laboratory studies are consistent with field data. The section on shoal choice behaviour in the laboratory is structured so that the evidence for different shoaling preferences is discussed in the context of their mechanisms and functions. Predictions based on experiments in captivity regarding preferences for conspecifics, individuals of similar body length and unparasitized fish were highly consistent with field observations on free-ranging shoals whereas preferences for familiar conspecifics and kin remain to be conclusively demonstrated in the field. In general, there is a shortage of studies in which shoaling preferences have been investigated both in the laboratory and the field, and field studies have so far been largely descriptive revealing little about the underlying mechanisms of observed patterns. Given the great importance of fish shoals both in fundamental and applied research, an advancement of our knowledge of their social organization should significantly contribute to a better understanding of a whole range of topics including reciprocal altruism, group-living and self-organization.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of molecular variation within and between populations is crucial to establish strategies for conservation as well as to detect the footprint of spatially heterogeneous selection. The traditional estimator of genetic differentiation (F(ST)) has been shown to be misleading if genetic diversity is high. Alternative estimators of F(ST) have been proposed, but their robustness to variation in mutation rate is not clearly established. We first investigated the effect of mutation and migration rate using computer simulations and examined their joint influence on Q(ST), a measure of genetic differentiation for quantitative traits. We further used experimental data in natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana to characterize the effect of mutation rate on various estimates of population differentiation. Since natural species exhibit various degrees of self-fertilisation, we also investigated the effect of mating system on the different estimators.If mutation rate is high and migration rate low, classical measures of genetic differentiation are misleading. Only Phi(ST), an estimator that takes the mutational distances between alleles into account, is independent of mutation rate, for all migration rates. However, the performance of Phi(ST) depends on the underlying mutation model and departures from this model cause its performance to degrade. We further show that Q(ST) has the same bias. We provide evidence that, in A. thaliana, microsatellite variation correlates with mutation rate. We thereby demonstrate that our results on estimators of genetic differentiation have important implications, even for species that are well established models in population genetics and molecular biology.We find that alternative measures of differentiation like F'(ST) and D are not suitable for estimating effective migration rate and should not be used in studies of local adaptation. Genetic differentiation should instead be measured using an estimator that takes mutation rate into account, such as Phi(ST). Furthermore, in systems where migration between populations is low, such as A. thaliana, Q(ST) < F(ST) cannot be taken as evidence for homogenising selection as has been traditionally thought.},

  Abstract                 = {There has recently been considerable debate over the relative importance of selection against hybrids ("endogenous" selection) vs. adaptation to different environments ("exogenous") in maintaining stable hybrid zones and hence in speciation. Single-locus models of endogenous and exogenous viability selection generate clines of similar shape, but the comparison has not been extended to multilocus systems, which are both quantitatively and qualitatively very different from the single-locus case. Here we develop an analytical multilocus model of differential adaptation across an environmental transition and compare it to previous heterozygote disadvantage models. We show that the shape of clines generated by exogenous selection is indistinguishable from that generated by endogenous selection. A stochastic simulation model is used to test the robustness of the analytical description to the effects of drift and strong selection, and confirms the prediction that pairwise linkage disequilibria are predominantly generated by migration. However, although analytical predictions for the width of clines maintained by heterozygote disadvantage fit well with the simulation results, those for environmental adaptation are consistently too narrow; reasons for the discrepancy are discussed. There is a smooth transition between a system in which a set of loci effectively act independently of each other and one in which they act as a single nonrecombining unit.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary pressures on proteins are often quantified by the ratio of substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites. The dN/dS ratio was originally developed for application to distantly diverged sequences, the differences among which represent substitutions that have fixed along independent lineages. Nevertheless, the dN/dS measure is often applied to sequences sampled from a single population, the differences among which represent segregating polymorphisms. Here, we study the expected dN/dS ratio for samples drawn from a single population under selection, and we find that in this context, dN/dS is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient. Moreover, the hallmark signature of positive selection over divergent lineages, dN/dS>1, is violated within a population. For population samples, the relationship between selection and dN/dS does not follow a monotonic function, and so it may be impossible to infer selection pressures from dN/dS. These results have significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples.},

  Abstract                 = {Although multiple gene sequences are becoming increasingly available for molecular phylogenetic inference, the analysis of such data has largely relied on inference methods designed for single genes. One of the common approaches to analyzing data from multiple genes is concatenation of the individual gene data to form a single supergene to which traditional phylogenetic inference procedures - e.g., maximum parsimony (MP) or maximum likelihood (ML) - are applied. Recent empirical studies have demonstrated that concatenation of sequences from multiple genes prior to phylogenetic analysis often results in inference of a single, well-supported phylogeny. Theoretical work, however, has shown that the coalescent can produce substantial variation in single-gene histories. Using simulation, we combine these ideas to examine the performance of the concatenation approach under conditions in which the coalescent produces a high level of discord among individual gene trees and show that it leads to statistically inconsistent estimation in this setting. Furthermore, use of the bootstrap to measure support for the inferred phylogeny can result in moderate to strong support for an incorrect tree under these conditions. These results highlight the importance of incorporating variation in gene histories into multilocus phylogenetics.},

Natural hybridization occurs between parapatric species of similar size. Two case studies of natural hybridization suggest that natural hybridization could have affected the evolution of this subgenus in different ways. When there is a large difference in genital morphology between hybridizing species, interspecific copulation often results in genital injuries that causes mortality of copulating individuals, and hence reduces the fitness of hybridizing individuals greatly. In such a case, hybridization may be effective in maintaining the parapatric distribution of the two species, and in the long term, may promote reinforcement selection for traits which are effective in prezygotic reproductive isolation. When the morphological difference in genitalia is not so large as to cause genital injury, a hybrid population may be established at the intermediate zone between two parental species, provided that the immigration rates of the two species into the intermediate zone are small. Thus, natural hybridization may have contributed to both divergence and reticulate evolution in this subgenus.},

  Abstract                 = {In nature, closely related species may hybridize while still retaining their distinctive identities. Chromosomal regions that experience reduced recombination in hybrids, such as within inversions, have been hypothesized to contribute to the maintenance of species integrity. Here, we examine genomic sequences from closely related fruit fly taxa of the Drosophila pseudoobscura subgroup to reconstruct their evolutionary histories and past patterns of genic exchange. Partial genomic assemblies were generated from two subspecies of Drosophila pseudoobscura (D. ps.) and an outgroup species, D. miranda. These new assemblies were compared to available assemblies of D. ps. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, two species with overlapping ranges in western North America. Within inverted regions, nucleotide divergence among each pair of the three species is comparable, whereas divergence between D. ps. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis in non-inverted regions is much lower and closer to levels of intraspecific variation. Using molecular markers flanking each of the major chromosomal inversions, we identify strong crossover suppression in F(1) hybrids extending over 2 megabase pairs (Mbp) beyond the inversion breakpoints. These regions of crossover suppression also exhibit the high nucleotide divergence associated with inverted regions. Finally, by comparison to a geographically isolated subspecies, D. ps. bogotana, our results suggest that autosomal gene exchange between the North American species, D. ps. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, occurred since the split of the subspecies, likely within the last 200,000 years. We conclude that chromosomal rearrangements have been vital to the ongoing persistence of these species despite recent hybridization. Our study serves as a proof-of-principle on how whole genome sequencing can be applied to formulate and test hypotheses about species formation in lesser-known non-model systems.},

Coupled with fast-declining, per-base sequencing costs, this influx of DNA sequence data has encouraged laboratory scientists to engage large datasets in comparative sequence analyses for making evolutionary, functional and translational inferences. However, the majority of the scientists at the forefront of experimental research are not bioinformaticians, so a gap exists between the user-friendly software needed and the scripting/programming infrastructure often employed for the analysis of large numbers of genes, long genomic segments and groups of sequences. We see an urgent need for the expansion of the fundamental paradigms under which biologist-friendly software tools are designed and developed to fulfill the needs of biologists to analyze large datasets by using sophisticated computational methods. We argue that the design principles need to be sensitive to the reality that comparatively small teams of biologists have historically developed some of the most popular biological software packages in molecular evolutionary analysis. Furthermore, biological intuitiveness and investigator empowerment need to take precedence over the current supposition that biologists should re-tool and become programmers when analyzing genome scale datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {Microsatellite markers are popular genetic markers frequently used in forensic biology. Despite their popularity, the characterisation of polymorphic microsatellite loci and development of suitable markers takes considerable effort. Newly-available genomic databases make it feasible to identify conserved genetic markers. We examined the utility and characteristics of conserved microsatellite markers in Charadriiformes (plovers, sandpipers, gulls and auks). This order harbours many species with diverse breeding systems, life histories and extraordinary migration biology whose genetics warrant investigation. However, research has been largely restrained by the limited availability of genetic markers. To examine the utility of conserved microsatellite loci as genetic markers we collated a database of Charadriiformes microsatellites, searched for homologues in the chicken genome and tested conserved markers for amplification and polymorphism in a range of charadriiform species.Sixty-eight (42\%) of 161 charadriiform microsatellite loci were assigned to a single location in the chicken genome based on their E-value. Fifty-five primers designed from conserved microsatellite loci with an E-value of E-10 or lower amplified across a wider range of charadriiform species than a control group of primers from ten anonymous microsatellite loci. Twenty-three of 24 examined conserved markers were polymorphic, each in on average 3 of 12 species tested.Genomic sequence databases are useful tools to identify conserved genetic markers including those located in non-coding regions. By maximising primer sequence similarity between source species and database species, markers can be further improved and provide additional markers to study the molecular ecology of populations of non-model organisms.},

In the post-processing of RNA-Seq reads, it incorporates gene models already at the stage of read alignment, increasing the number of reliably measured known transcripts consistently by 50\%. Adding genes identified de novo then allows a reliable assessment of double the total number of transcripts compared to other available pipelines. This substantial improvement is of general relevance: Measurement precision determines the power of any analysis to reliably identify significant signals, such as in screens for differential expression, independent of whether the experimental design incorporates replicates or not.},

Failure of endosperm development will ultimately cause embryo arrest and seed lethality, a phenomenon that is frequently observed upon hybridization of related plant species or species that differ in ploidy. Endosperm-based interspecies or interploidy hybridization barriers depend on the direction of the hybridization, causing nonreciprocal seed defects. This reveals that the parental genomes are not equivalent, implicating parent-of-origin specific genes generating this type of hybridization barrier. Recent work revealed that endosperm-based hybridization barriers are rapidly evolving. In this review, we discuss the developmental mechanisms causing hybrid seed lethality in angiosperms as well as the evolutionary forces establishing endosperm-based postzygotic hybridization barriers.},

If certain simple criteria are satisfied approximately on an appropriate scale of measurement, nE can be estimated by comparing the phenotypic means and variances in the two parental populations and in their F1 and F2 hybrids (and backcrosses). This generalizes the method of Wright to genetically heterogeneous (or wild) parental populations, as well as inbred lines. Standard errors of the estimates are derived for large samples. The minimum number of genes involved in producing a large difference between populations in a quantitative trait is typically estimated to be about 5 or 10, with occasional values up to 20. This strongly supports the neo-Darwinian theory that large evolutionary changes usually occur by the accumulation of multiple genetic factors with relatively small effects.},

Despite stabilizing natural selection on males, various types of mating preferences may create a runaway process in which the outcome of phenotypic evolution depends critically on the genetic variation parameters and initial conditions of a population. Even in the absence of genetic instability, rapid evolution can result from an interaction of natural and sexual selection with random genetic drift along lines of equilibria. The models elucidate genetic mechanisms that can initiate or contribute to rapid speciation by sexual isolation and divergence of secondary sexual characters.},

  Abstract                 = {Multivariate statistical methods are derived for measuring selection solely from observed changes in the distribution of phenotypic characters in a population within a generation. Selective effects are readily detectable in characters that do not change with age, such as meristic traits or adult characters in species with determinate growth. Ontogenetic characters, including allometric growth rates, can be analyzed in longitudinal studies where individuals are followed through time. Following an approach pioneered by Pearson (1903), this analysis helps to reveal the target(s) of selection, and to quantify its intensity, without identifying the selective agent(s). By accounting for indirect selection through correlated characters, separate forces of directional and stabilizing (or disruptive) selection acting directly on each character can be measured. These directional and stabilizing selection coefficients are respectively the parameters that describe the best linear and quadratic approximations to the selective surface of individual fitness as a function of the phenotypic characters. The theory is illustrated by estimating selective forces on morphological characters influencing survival in pentatomid bugs and in house sparrows during severe weather conditions.},

Finally, we consider and preview novel technologies that could help decipher how divergent transcriptional networks interact in hybrids between species.},

  Abstract                 = {Many conserved eukaryotic traits, including apoptosis, two sexes, speciation and ageing, can be causally linked to a bioenergetic requirement for mitochondrial genes. Mitochondrial genes encode proteins involved in cell respiration, which interact closely with proteins encoded by nuclear genes. Functional respiration requires the coadaptation of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, despite divergent tempi and modes of evolution. Free-radical signals emerge directly from the biophysics of mosaic respiratory chains encoded by two genomes prone to mismatch, with apoptosis being the default penalty for compromised respiration. Selection for genomic matching is facilitated by two sexes, and optimizes fitness, adaptability and fertility in youth. Mismatches cause infertility, low fitness, hybrid breakdown, and potentially speciation. The dynamics of selection for mitonuclear function optimize fitness over generations, but the same selective processes also operate within generations, driving ageing and age-related diseases. This coherent view of eukaryotic energetics offers striking insights into infertility and age-related diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {All complex life on Earth is eukaryotic. All eukaryotic cells share a common ancestor that arose just once in four billion years of evolution. Prokaryotes show no tendency to evolve greater morphological complexity, despite their metabolic virtuosity. Here I argue that the eukaryotic cell originated in a unique prokaryotic endosymbiosis, a singular event that transformed the selection pressures acting on both host and endosymbiont.The reductive evolution and specialisation of endosymbionts to mitochondria resulted in an extreme genomic asymmetry, in which the residual mitochondrial genomes enabled the expansion of bioenergetic membranes over several orders of magnitude, overcoming the energetic constraints on prokaryotic genome size, and permitting the host cell genome to expand (in principle) over 200,000-fold. This energetic transformation was permissive, not prescriptive; I suggest that the actual increase in early eukaryotic genome size was driven by a heavy early bombardment of genes and introns from the endosymbiont to the host cell, producing a high mutation rate. Unlike prokaryotes, with lower mutation rates and heavy selection pressure to lose genes, early eukaryotes without genome-size limitations could mask mutations by cell fusion and genome duplication, as in allopolyploidy, giving rise to a proto-sexual cell cycle. The side effect was that a large number of shared eukaryotic basal traits accumulated in the same population, a sexual eukaryotic common ancestor, radically different to any known prokaryote.The combination of massive bioenergetic expansion, release from genome-size constraints, and high mutation rate favoured a protosexual cell cycle and the accumulation of eukaryotic traits. These factors explain the unique origin of eukaryotes, the absence of true evolutionary intermediates, and the evolution of sex in eukaryotes but not prokaryotes.This article was reviewed by: Eugene Koonin, William Martin, Ford Doolittle and Mark van der Giezen.

But soup is homogeneous in pH and redox potential, and so has no capacity for energy coupling by chemiosmosis. Thermodynamic constraints make chemiosmosis strictly necessary for carbon and energy metabolism in all free-living chemotrophs, and presumably the first free-living cells too. Proton gradients form naturally at alkaline hydrothermal vents and are viewed as central to the origin of life. Here we consider how the earliest cells might have harnessed a geochemically created proton-motive force and then learned to make their own, a transition that was necessary for their escape from the vents. Synthesis of ATP by chemiosmosis today involves generation of an ion gradient by means of vectorial electron transfer from a donor to an acceptor. We argue that the first donor was hydrogen and the first acceptor CO2.},

  Abstract                 = {Some methods for demographic inference based on the observed genetic diversity of current populations rely on the use of summary statistics such as the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS). Demographic models can be either model-constrained with numerous parameters such as growth rates, timing of demographic events and migration rates, or model-flexible, with an unbounded collection of piecewise constant sizes. It is still debated whether demographic histories can be accurately inferred based on the SFS. Here we illustrate this theoretical issue on an example of demographic inference for an African population. The SFS of the Yoruba population (data from the 1000 Genomes Project) is fit to a simple model of population growth described with a single parameter (e.g., founding time). We infer a time to the most recent common ancestor of 1.7 million years for this population. However, we show that the Yoruba SFS is not informative enough to discriminate between several different models of growth. We also show that for such simple demographies, the fit of one-parameter models outperforms the model-flexible method recently developed by Liu and Fu. The use of this method on simulated data suggests that it is biased by the noise intrinsically present in the data.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic variability in a subdivided population under stabilizing and diversifying selection was investigated at three levels: neutral markers, QTL coding for a trait, and the trait itself. A quantitative model with additive effects was used to link genotypes to phenotypes. No physical linkage was introduced. Using an analytical approach, we compared the diversity within deme (H(S)) and the differentiation (F(ST)) at the QTL with the genetic variance within deme (V(W)) and the differentiation (Q(ST)) for the trait. The difference between F(ST) and Q(ST) was shown to depend on the relative amounts of covariance between QTL within and between demes. Simulations were used to study the effect of selection intensity, variance of optima among demes, and migration rate for an allogamous and predominantly selfing species. Contrasting dynamics of the genetic variability at markers, QTL, and trait were observed as a function of the level of gene flow and diversifying selection. The highest discrepancy among the three levels occurred under highly diversifying selection and high gene flow. Furthermore, diversifying selection might cause substantial heterogeneity among QTL, only a few of them showing allelic differentiation, while the others behave as neutral markers.},

  Abstract                 = {Reductions in the cost of sequencing have enabled whole-genome sequencing to identify sequence variants segregating in a population. An efficient approach is to sequence many samples at low coverage, then to combine data across samples to detect shared variants. Here, we present methods to discover and genotype single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites from low-coverage sequencing data, making use of shared haplotype (linkage disequilibrium) information. For each population, we first collect SNP candidates based on independent sequence calls per site. We then use MARGARITA with genotype or phased haplotype data from the same samples to collect 20 ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs). We refine the posterior probability of SNP candidates by considering possible mutations at internal branches of the 40 marginal ancestral trees inferred from the 20 ARGs at the left and right flanking genotype sites. Using a population genetic prior distribution on tree-branch length and Bayesian inference, we determine a posterior probability of the SNP being real and also the most probable phased genotype call for each individual. We present experiments on both simulation data and real data from the 1000 Genomes Project to prove the applicability of the methods. We also explore the relative tradeoff between sequencing depth and the number of sequenced samples.},

  Abstract                 = {Genome resequencing and short read mapping are two of the primary tools of genomics and are used for many important applications. The current state-of-the-art in mapping uses the quality values and mapping quality scores to evaluate the reliability of the mapping. These attributes, however, are assigned to individual reads and do not directly measure the problematic repeats across the genome. Here, we present the Genome Mappability Score (GMS) as a novel measure of the complexity of resequencing a genome. The GMS is a weighted probability that any read could be unambiguously mapped to a given position and thus measures the overall composition of the genome itself.We have developed the Genome Mappability Analyzer to compute the GMS of every position in a genome. It leverages the parallelism of cloud computing to analyze large genomes, and enabled us to identify the 5-14\% of the human, mouse, fly and yeast genomes that are difficult to analyze with short reads. We examined the accuracy of the widely used BWA/SAMtools polymorphism discovery pipeline in the context of the GMS, and found discovery errors are dominated by false negatives, especially in regions with poor GMS. These errors are fundamental to the mapping process and cannot be overcome by increasing coverage. As such, the GMS should be considered in every resequencing project to pinpoint the 'dark matter' of the genome, including of known clinically relevant variations in these regions.The source code and profiles of several model organisms are available at http://gma-bio.sourceforge.net},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a placebo treatment on cough in patients with cough associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). METHODS: Patients with dry or slightly productive cough associated with a history of URTI were recruited. Cough frequency (CF) over 15 minutes was recorded by means of a microphone connected to a pen recorder. Cough suppression time (CST) was recorded when patients were instructed by means of a red light to try not to cough. Patients received either a single dose of vitamin E (placebo treatment) or no treatment. CF and CST were recorded before and 15 minutes after treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were randomized to placebo treatment and 27 to the no-treatment group (mean age 22.6 years). The median difference between post- and pretreatment CF was -3 in the no-treatment group and -18 in the placebo group (p = .0003). There was a significant increase in CST in the placebo group compared with no treatment (p = .027). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that placebo treatment has significant antitussive activity. This placebo effect may be related to generation of central neurotransmitters such as endogenous opioids.},

There is also an associated wing reduction, since Ô¨Çight is no longer required to evade bats. Wing reduction may also affect sound production. Here, the auditory system in four silent grasshopper species belonging to the Podismini is investigated. In this group, tympanal ears occur but sound signalling does not. The tympanal organs range from fully developed to remarkably reduced tympana. To evaluate the effects of tympanal regression on neuronal organisation and auditory sensitiv- ity, the size of wings and tympana, sensory thresholds and sensory central projections are compared. Reduced tympanal size correlates with a higher auditory threshold. The threshold curves of all four species are tuned to low frequencies with a maximal sensitivity at 3?Äì5 kHz. Central projections of the tympanal nerve show characteristics known from fully tympanate acridid species, so neural elements for tympanal hearing have been strongly con- served across these species. The results also conÔ¨Årm the correlation between reduction in auditory sensitivity and wing reduction. It is concluded that the auditory sensitivity of all four species may be maintained by stabilising selective forces, such as predation.},

Previous phylogenetic work has required labor-intensive marker development coupled with single-locus polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing on clade-by-clade and locus-by-locus basis. Here, we present a new, cost-efficient, and rapid approach to obtaining data from hundreds of loci for potentially hundreds of individuals for deep and shallow phylogenetic studies. Specifically, we designed probes for target enrichment of >500 loci in highly conserved anchor regions of vertebrate genomes (flanked by less conserved regions) from five model species and tested enrichment efficiency in nonmodel species up to 508 million years divergent from the nearest model. We found that hybrid enrichment using conserved probes (anchored enrichment) can recover a large number of unlinked loci that are useful at a diversity of phylogenetic timescales. This new approach has the potential not only to expedite resolution of deep-scale portions of the Tree of Life but also to greatly accelerate resolution of the large number of shallow clades that remain unresolved. The combination of low cost (~1\% of the cost of traditional Sanger sequencing and ~3.5\% of the cost of high-throughput amplicon sequencing for projects on the scale of 500 loci × 100 individuals) and rapid data collection (~2 weeks of laboratory time) are expected to make this approach tractable even for researchers working on systems with limited or nonexistent genomic resources.},

Here, we present a new, cost-efficient, and rapid approach to obtaining data from hundreds of loci for potentially hundreds of individuals for deep and shallow phylogenetic studies. Specifically, we designed probes for target enrichment of >500 loci in highly conserved anchor regions of vertebrate genomes (flanked by less conserved regions) from five model species and tested enrichment efficiency in nonmodel species up to 508 million years divergent from the nearest model. We found that hybrid enrichment using conserved probes (anchored enrichment) can recover a large number of unlinked loci that are useful at a diversity of phylogenetic timescales. This new approach has the potential not only to expedite resolution of deep-scale portions of the Tree of Life but also to greatly accelerate resolution of the large number of shallow clades that remain unresolved. The combination of low cost (∼1% of the cost of traditional Sanger sequencing and ∼3.5% of the cost of high-throughput amplicon sequencing for projects on the scale of 500 loci × 100 individuals) and rapid data collection (∼2 weeks of laboratory time) are expected to make this approach tractable even for researchers working on systems with limited or nonexistent genomic resources.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the major challenges for researchers studying phylogeography and shallow-scale phylogenetics is the identification of highly variable and informative nuclear loci for the question of interest. Previous approaches to locus identification have generally required extensive testing of anonymous nuclear loci developed from genomic libraries of the target taxon, testing of loci of unknown utility from other systems, or identification of loci from the nearest model organism with genomic resources. Here, we present a fast and economical approach to generating thousands of variable, single-copy nuclear loci for any system using next-generation sequencing. We performed Illumina paired-end sequencing of three reduced-representation libraries (RRLs) in chorus frogs (Pseudacris) to identify orthologous, single-copy loci across libraries and to estimate sequence divergence at multiple taxonomic levels. We also conducted PCR testing of these loci across the genus Pseudacris and outgroups to determine whether loci developed for phylogeography can be extended to deeper phylogenetic levels. Prior to sequencing, we conducted in silico digestion of the most closely related reference genome (Xenopus tropicalis) to generate expectations for the number of loci and degree of coverage for a particular experimental design. Using the RRL approach, we: (i) identified more than 100,000 single-copy nuclear loci, 6339 of which were obtained for divergent conspecifics and 904 of which were obtained for heterospecifics; (ii) estimated average nuclear sequence divergence at 0.1\% between alleles within an individual, 1.1\% between conspecific individuals that represent two different clades, and 1.8\% between species; and (iii) determined from PCR testing that 53\% of the loci successfully amplify within-species and also many amplify to the genus-level and deeper in the phylogeny (16\%). Our study effectively identified nuclear loci present in the genome that have levels of sequence divergence on par with mitochondrial loci commonly used in phylogeography. Specifically, we estimated that ~7\% of loci in the chorus frog genome are >3\% divergent within species; this translates to a prediction of approximately 50,000 single-copy loci in the genome with >3\% divergence. Moreover, successful amplification of many loci at deeper phylogenetic levels indicates that the RRL approach represents an efficient method for rapid identification of informative loci for both phylogenetics and phylogeography. We conclude by making recommendations for minimizing the cost and maximizing the efficiency of locus identification for future studies in this field.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic variation in coding regions is of strong interest for biologists as it represents an important factor that drives evolution. To analyse polymorphic loci, researchers usually rely on commonly used typing techniques such as cloning, SSCP, DGGE or RSCA. However, there are potential pitfalls in screening multi-allelic templates, which are mainly the formation of sequence chimeras during PCR amplification, and mosaic sequences during cloning. One of the most challenging genomic regions to explore is the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), which codes for peptide-binding proteins of the vertebrate's adaptive immune system and is well known for its exceptional polymorphism. We compared the effect of two different PCR amplification approaches in a study of the MHC class IIB genes of the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). One approach used standard PCR conditions and the other a combination of several measures to eliminate PCR artefacts. In both approaches, the amplicons obtained were cloned and sequenced. In the first, established approach, 24\% of the clones represented artefacts, while in the second approach the number of artefacts were reduced ten-fold. Furthermore, it enabled easy differentiation between real alleles and artificial sequences. We also analysed the potential effects of such artefacts in genetic analysis and evolutionary interpretation, and found a slight reduction in the signature of positive selection and an increase in recombination events. Consequently, we strongly recommend to apply the new PCR approach described in this study when genotyping MHC or other polymorphic genes.},

Previously published results from a pilot study with carcinogen-treated mice, however, suggested tumor-promoting effects of RF-EMF (Tillmann et¬†al., 2010). We have performed a replication study using higher numbers of animals per group and including two additional exposure levels (0 (sham), 0.04, 0.4 and 2¬†W/kg SAR). We could confirm and extend the originally reported findings. Numbers of tumors of the lungs and livers in exposed animals were significantly higher than in sham-exposed controls. In addition, lymphomas were also found to be significantly elevated by exposure. A clear dose‚Äìresponse effect is absent. We hypothesize that these tumor-promoting effects may be caused by metabolic changes due to exposure. Since many of the tumor-promoting effects in our study were seen at low to moderate exposure levels (0.04 and 0.4¬†W/kg SAR), thus well below exposure limits for the users of mobile phones, further studies are warranted to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Our findings may help to understand the repeatedly reported increased incidences of brain tumors in heavy users of mobile phones. },

In a previous study more than 15,000 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences resulting from 454 pyrosequencing of Pinus contorta cDNA were identified. From these we developed PCR primers for approximately 4000 candidate SSRs. Here, we tested 184 of these SSRs for successful amplification across P. contorta and eight other pine species and examined patterns of polymorphism and allelic variability for a subset of these SSRs. Cross-species transferability was high, with high percentages of loci producing PCR products in all species tested. In addition, 50\% of the loci we screened across panels of individuals from three of these species were polymorphic and allelically diverse. We examined levels of diversity in a subset of these SSRs by collecting genotypic data across several populations of Pinus ponderosa in northern Wyoming. Our results indicate the utility of mining pyrosequenced EST collections for gene-based SSRs and provide a source of molecular markers that should bolster evolutionary genetic investigations across the genus Pinus.},

Using data from human populations we have shown highly significant heterogeneity in F values for human polymorphic genes over the world, thus demonstrating that a significant fraction of human polymorphisms owe their current gene frequencies to the action of natural selection.

However, its potential in other organisms has not yet been evaluated. Here, we use DNA microsatellites to assess the feasibility of this approach in hybrid zones between two members of the 'model tree' genus Populus: Populus alba (white poplar) and Populus tremula (European aspen). We analyzed samples of both species and a Central European hybrid zone (N=544 chromosomes) for a genome-wide set of 19 polymorphic DNA microsatellites. Our results indicate that allele frequency differentials between the two species are substantial (mean delta=0.619+/-0.067). Background linkage disequilibrium (LD) in samples of the parental gene pools is moderate and should respond to sampling schemes that minimize drift and account for rare alleles. LD in hybrids decays with increasing number of backcross generations as expected from theory and approaches background levels of the parental gene pools in advanced generation backcrosses. Introgression from P. tremula into P. alba varies strongly across marker loci. For several markers, alleles from P. tremula are slightly over-represented relative to neutral expectations, whereas a single locus exhibits evidence of selection against P. tremula genotypes. We interpret our results in terms of the potential for admixture mapping in these two ecologically divergent Populus species, and we validate a modified approach of studying genotypic clines in 'mosaic' hybrid zones.},

  Abstract                 = { Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) methods have become standard tools in a wide range of DNA analysis applications. But many aspects of DNA migration phenomena under pulsed field conditions are not well understood as compared with the more conventional situation where the electric field is held constant. A key reason for this deficiency is that PFGE experiments are cumbersome to perform due to extremely long separation times (â¼10â15 h) and the need to perform gel analysis by poststaining after completion of the run. Here we introduce an easy to build miniaturized slab gel apparatus that addresses these issues by enabling large DNA fragments up to 35 kb in length to be separated using field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) in 60â90 min. The compact size of the device also allows the entire gel to be continuously monitored so that the separation processes can be imaged in real time using a high-resolution CCD camera. Arbitrary control over the applied voltage waveforms is achieved using a function generator interfaced with a high voltage amplifier. These capabilities allow us to probe the size dependence of fundamental physical parameters associated with DNA migration (mobility, diffusion, and separation resolution). These data reveal a surprising regime where separation resolution increases with DNA fragment size owing to a favorable interplay between mobility and diffusion scalings and highlight the important role of diffusion (a seldom quantified parameter). In addition to the practical benefit of separation times that are an order of magnitude faster than conventional instruments, the results of these studies provide a previously unavailable rational basis to identify optimal separation conditions and contribute new insights toward understanding the underlying physical processes that govern DNA electrophoresis in pulsed fields. },

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Whole-genome high-coverage sequencing has been widely used for personal and cancer genomics as well as in various research areas. However, in the lack of an unbiased whole-genome truth set, the global error rate of variant calls and the leading causal artifacts still remain unclear even given the great efforts in the evaluation of variant calling methods. Results: We made ten SNP and INDEL call sets with two read mappers and five variant callers, both on a haploid human genome and a diploid genome at a similar coverage. By investigating false heterozygous calls in the haploid genome, we identified the erroneous realignment in low-complexity regions and the incomplete reference genome with respect to the sample as the two major sources of errors, which press for continued improvements in these two areas. We estimated that the error rate of raw genotype calls is as high as 1 in 10-15kb, but the error rate of post-filtered calls is reduced to 1 in 100-200kb without significant compromise on the sensitivity.

  Abstract                 = {Eugene Myers in his string graph paper suggested that in a string graph or equivalently a unitig graph, any path spells a valid assembly. As a string/unitig graph also encodes every valid assembly of reads, such a graph, provided that it can be constructed correctly, is in fact a lossless representation of reads. In principle, every analysis based on whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) data, such as SNP and insertion/deletion (INDEL) calling, can also be achieved with unitigs.To explore the feasibility of using de novo assembly in the context of resequencing, we developed a de novo assembler, fermi, that assembles Illumina short reads into unitigs while preserving most of information of the input reads. SNPs and INDELs can be called by mapping the unitigs against a reference genome. By applying the method on 35-fold human resequencing data, we showed that in comparison to the standard pipeline, our approach yields similar accuracy for SNP calling and better results for INDEL calling. It has higher sensitivity than other de novo assembly based methods for variant calling. Our work suggests that variant calling with de novo assembly can be a beneficial complement to the standard variant calling pipeline for whole-genome resequencing. In the methodological aspects, we propose FMD-index for forward-backward extension of DNA sequences, a fast algorithm for finding all super-maximal exact matches and one-pass construction of unitigs from an FMD-index.http://github.com/lh3/fermi},

However, in applications of the next-generation sequencing (NGS), accurate genotypes may not be easily obtained (e.g. multi-sample low-coverage sequencing or somatic mutation discovery). These applications press for the development of new methods for analyzing sequence data with uncertainty.We present a statistical framework for calling SNPs, discovering somatic mutations, inferring population genetical parameters and performing association tests directly based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or linkage-based imputation. On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for inferring allele frequency spectrum and for association mapping. We also highlight the necessity of using symmetric datasets for finding somatic mutations and confirm that for discovering rare events, mismapping is frequently the leading source of errors.http://samtools.sourceforge.net.hengli@broadinstitute.org.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with BurrowsâWheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is â¼10â20Ã faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.Availability: http://maq.sourceforge.netContact: rd@sanger.ac.uk},

However, some of these technologies produce very short reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short reads to a reference genome and handling ambiguity or lack of accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence of a diploid genome, e.g., from a human sample. MAQ makes full use of mate-pair information and estimates the error probability of each read alignment. Error probabilities are also derived for the final genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates the mapping qualities, error probabilities from the raw sequence quality scores, sampling of the two haplotypes, and an empirical model for correlated errors at a site. Both read mapping and genotype calling are evaluated on simulated data and real data. MAQ is accurate, efficient, versatile, and user-friendly. It is freely available at http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

  Abstract                 = {Accelerated losses of biodiversity are a hallmark of the current era. Large declines of population size have been widely observed and currently 22,176 species are threatened by extinction. The time at which a threatened species began rapid population decline (RPD) and the rate of RPD provide important clues about the driving forces of population decline and anticipated extinction time. However, these parameters remain unknown for the vast majority of threatened species. Here we analyzed the genetic diversity data of nuclear and mitochondrial loci of 2,764 vertebrate species and found that the mean genetic diversity is lower in threatened species than in related nonthreatened species. Our coalescence-based modeling suggests that in many threatened species the RPD began ∼123 y ago (a 95% confidence interval of 20–260 y). This estimated date coincides with widespread industrialization and a profound change in global living ecosystems over the past two centuries. On average the population size declined by ∼25% every 10 y in a threatened species, and the population size was reduced to ∼5% of its ancestral size. Moreover, the ancestral size of threatened species was, on average, ∼22% smaller than that of nonthreatened species. Because the time period of RPD is short, the cumulative effect of RPD on genetic diversity is still not strong, so that the smaller ancestral size of threatened species may be the major cause of their reduced genetic diversity; RPD explains 24.1–37.5% of the difference in genetic diversity between threatened and nonthreatened species.},

  Abstract                 = {The identification of orthologous groups is useful for genome annotation, studies on gene/protein evolution, comparative genomics, and the identification of taxonomically restricted sequences. Methods successfully exploited for prokaryotic genome analysis have proved difficult to apply to eukaryotes, however, as larger genomes may contain multiple paralogous genes, and sequence information is often incomplete. OrthoMCL provides a scalable method for constructing orthologous groups across multiple eukaryotic taxa, using a Markov Cluster algorithm to group (putative) orthologs and paralogs. This method performs similarly to the INPARANOID algorithm when applied to two genomes, but can be extended to cluster orthologs from multiple species. OrthoMCL clusters are coherent with groups identified by EGO, but improved recognition of "recent" paralogs permits overlapping EGO groups representing the same gene to be merged. Comparison with previously assigned EC annotations suggests a high degree of reliability, implying utility for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL has been applied to the proteome data set from seven publicly available genomes (human, fly, worm, yeast, Arabidopsis, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and Escherichia coli). A Web interface allows queries based on individual genes or user-defined phylogenetic patterns (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/gene-family). Analysis of clusters incorporating P. falciparum genes identifies numerous enzymes that were incompletely annotated in first-pass annotation of the parasite genome.},

  Abstract                 = {In shotgun sequencing, statistical reconstruction of a consensus from alignment requires a model of measurement error. Churchill and Waterman proposed one such model and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate sequencing error rates for each assembly matrix. Ewing and Green defined Phred quality scores for base-calling from sequencing traces by training a model on a large amount of data. However, sample preparations and sequencing machines may work under different conditions in practice and therefore quality scores need to be adjusted. Moreover, the information given by quality scores is incomplete in the sense that they do not describe error patterns. We observe that each nucleotide base has its specific error pattern that varies across the range of quality values. We develop models of measurement error for shotgun sequencing by combining the two perspectives above. We propose a logistic model taking quality scores as covariates. The model is trained by a procedure combining an EM algorithm and model selection techniques. The training results in calibration of quality values and leads to a more accurate construction of consensus. Besides Phred scores obtained from ABI sequencers, we apply the same technique to calibrate quality values that come along with Beckman sequencers.},

One of the key applications of next-generation sequencing is studying genetic variation between individuals using whole-genome or target region resequencing. Here, we have developed a consensus-calling and SNP-detection method for sequencing-by-synthesis Illumina Genome Analyzer technology. We designed this method by carefully considering the data quality, alignment, and experimental errors common to this technology. All of this information was integrated into a single quality score for each base under Bayesian theory to measure the accuracy of consensus calling. We tested this methodology using a large-scale human resequencing data set of 36x coverage and assembled a high-quality nonrepetitive consensus sequence for 92.25\% of the diploid autosomes and 88.07\% of the haploid X chromosome. Comparison of the consensus sequence with Illumina human 1M BeadChip genotyped alleles from the same DNA sample showed that 98.6\% of the 37,933 genotyped alleles on the X chromosome and 98\% of 999,981 genotyped alleles on autosomes were covered at 99.97\% and 99.84\% consistency, respectively. At a low sequencing depth, we used prior probability of dbSNP alleles and were able to improve coverage of the dbSNP sites significantly as compared to that obtained using a nonimputation model. Our analyses demonstrate that our method has a very low false call rate at any sequencing depth and excellent genome coverage at a high sequencing depth.},

SOAP2 is compatible with both single- and paired-end reads. Additionally, this tool now supports multiple text and compressed file formats.

  Abstract                 = {Sterility is a commonly observed phenotype in interspecific hybrids. Sterility may result from chromosomal or genic incompatibilities, and much progress has been made toward understanding the genetic basis of hybrid sterility in various taxa. The underlying mechanisms causing hybrid sterility, however, are less well known. The pachytene checkpoint is a meiotic surveillance system that many organisms use to detect aberrant meiotic products, in order to prevent the production of defective gametes. We suggest that activation of the pachytene checkpoint may be an important mechanism contributing to two types of hybrid sterility. First, the pachytene checkpoint may form the mechanistic basis of some gene-based hybrid sterility phenotypes. Second, the pachytene checkpoint may be an important mechanism that mediates chromosomal-based hybrid sterility phenotypes involving gametes with non-haploid (either non-reduced or aneuploid) chromosome sets. Studies in several species suggest that the strength of the pachytene checkpoint is sexually dimorphic, observations that warrant future investigation into whether such variation may contribute to differences in patterns of sterility between male and female interspecific hybrids. In addition, plants seem to lack the pachytene checkpoint, which correlates with increased production of unreduced gametes and a higher incidence of polyploid species in plants versus animals. Although the pachytene checkpoint occurs in many animals and in fungi, at least some of the genes that execute the pachytene checkpoint are different among organisms. This finding suggests that the penetrance of the pachytene checkpoint, and even its presence or absence can evolve rapidly. The surprising degree of evolutionary flexibility in this meiotic surveillance system may contribute to the observed variation in patterns of hybrid sterility and in rates of polyploidization.},

These new sequencing technologies have resulted in the successful identification of causal variants for several rare Mendelian disorders. They have also begun to deliver on their promise to explain some of the missing heritability from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits. We anticipate a rapidly growing number of MPS-based studies for a diverse range of applications in the near future. One crucial and nearly inevitable step is to detect SNPs and call genotypes at the detected polymorphic sites from the sequencing data. Here, we review statistical methods that have been proposed in the past five years for this purpose. In addition, we discuss emerging issues and future directions related to SNP detection and genotype calling from MPS data.},

  Abstract                 = {New sequencing technologies allow genomic variation to be surveyed in much greater detail than previously possible. While detailed analysis of a single individual typically requires deep sequencing, when many individuals are sequenced it is possible to combine shallow sequence data across individuals to generate accurate calls in shared stretches of chromosome. Here, we show that, as progressively larger numbers of individuals are sequenced, increasingly accurate genotype calls can be generated for a given sequence depth. We evaluate the implications of low-coverage sequencing for complex trait association studies. We systematically compare study designs based on genotyping of tagSNPs, sequencing of many individuals at depths ranging between 2× and 30×, and imputation of variants discovered by sequencing a subset of individuals into the remainder of the sample. We show that sequencing many individuals at low depth is an attractive strategy for studies of complex trait genetics. For example, for disease-associated variants with frequency >0.2\%, sequencing 3000 individuals at 4× depth provides similar power to deep sequencing of >2000 individuals at 30× depth but requires only ~20\% of the sequencing effort. We also show low-coverage sequencing can be used to build a reference panel that can drive imputation into additional samples to increase power further. We provide guidance for investigators wishing to combine results from sequenced, genotyped, and imputed samples.},

We report exome sequencing of 200 individuals from Denmark with targeted capture of 18,654 coding genes and sequence coverage of each individual exome at an average depth of 12-fold. On average, about 95\% of the target regions were covered by at least one read. We identified 121,870 SNPs in the sample population, including 53,081 coding SNPs (cSNPs). Using a statistical method for SNP calling and an estimation of allelic frequencies based on our population data, we derived the allele frequency spectrum of cSNPs with a minor allele frequency greater than 0.02. We identified a 1.8-fold excess of deleterious, non-syonomyous cSNPs over synonymous cSNPs in the low-frequency range (minor allele frequencies between 2\% and 5\%). This excess was more pronounced for X-linked SNPs, suggesting that deleterious substitutions are primarily recessive.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Several new de novo assembly tools have been developed recently to assemble short sequencing reads generated by next-generation sequencing platforms. However, the performance of these tools under various conditions has not been fully investigated, and sufficient information is not currently available for informed decisions to be made regarding the tool that would be most likely to produce the best performance under a specific set of conditions.Results: We studied and compared the performance of commonly used de novo assembly tools specifically designed for next-generation sequencing data, including SSAKE, VCAKE, Euler-sr, Edena, Velvet, ABySS and SOAPdenovo. Tools were compared using several performance criteria, including N50 length, sequence coverage and assembly accuracy. Various properties of read data, including single-end/paired-end, sequence GC content, depth of coverage and base calling error rates, were investigated for their effects on the performance of different assembly tools. We also compared the computation time and memory usage of these seven tools. Based on the results of our comparison, the relative performance of individual tools are summarized and tentative guidelines for optimal selection of different assembly tools, under different conditions, are provided.Contact: hdeng2@tulane.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:With the advent of next-generation sequencing there is an increased demand for tools to pre-process and handle the vast amounts of data generated. One recurring problem is adapter contamination in the reads, i.e. the partial or complete sequencing of adapter sequences. These adapter sequences have to be removed as they can hinder correct mapping of the reads and influence SNP calling and other downstream analyses.FINDINGS:We present a tool called AdapterRemoval which is able to pre-process both single and paired-end data. The program locates and removes adapter residues from the reads, it is able to combine paired reads if they overlap, and it can optionally trim low-quality nucleotides. Furthermore, it can look for adapter sequence in both the 5' and 3' ends of the reads. This is a flexible tool that can be tuned to accommodate different experimental settings and sequencing platforms producing FASTQ files. AdapterRemoval is shown to be good at trimming adapters from both single-end and paired-end data.CONCLUSIONS:AdapterRemoval is a comprehensive tool for analyzing next-generation sequencing data. It exhibits good performance both in terms of sensitivity and specificity. AdapterRemoval has already been used in various large projects and it is possible to extend it further to accommodate application-specific biases in the data.},

Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were significantly more centromeric than loci identified by three other techniques (allozymes, microsatellites, and PCR using primer sequences from interspersed nuclear elements). The near absence of AFLPs in distal regions could limit their utility in constructing linkage maps. A large proportion of loci had frequency of second division segregation (y) values approaching 1.0, indicating near complete crossover interference on many chromosome arms. As predicted from models of chromosomal evolution in salmonids based upon results with allozyme loci, all duplicated microsatellite loci that shared alleles (isoloci) had y values of nearly 1.0.},

Color variation in an admixed population suggests that this light Sand Hills phenotype is composed of multiple traits. We identified distinct regions within the Agouti locus associated with each color trait and found that only haplotypes associated with light trait values have evidence of selection. Thus, local adaptation is the result of independent selection on many mutations within a single locus, each with a specific effect on an adaptive phenotype, thereby minimizing pleiotropic consequences.},

  Abstract                 = {Genomic maps of transcription factor binding sites and histone modification patterns provide unique insight into the nature of gene regulatory networks and chromatin structure. These systematic studies use microarrays to analyze the composition of DNA isolated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. To obtain quantities sufficient for microarray analysis, the isolated DNA must be amplified. Current protocols use PCR-based approaches to amplify in exponential fashion. However, exponential amplification protocols are highly susceptible to bias. Linear amplification strategies minimize amplification bias and have had a profound impact on mRNA expression analysis. These protocols have yet to be applied to the analysis of genomic DNA due to the lack of a suitable tag such as the polyA tail.We have developed a novel linear amplification protocol for genomic DNA. Terminal transferase is used to add polyT tails to the ends of DNA fragments. Tail length uniformity is ensured by including a limiting concentration of the terminating nucleotide ddCTP. Second strand synthesis using a T7-polyA primer adapter yields double stranded templates suitable for in vitro transcription (IVT). Using this approach, we are able to amplify as little as 2.5 ng of genomic DNA, while retaining the size distribution of the starting material. In contrast, we find that PCR amplification is biased towards species of greater size. Furthermore, extensive microarray-based analyses reveal that our linear amplification protocol preserves dynamic range and species representation more effectively than a commonly used PCR-based approach.We present a T7-based linear amplification protocol for genomic DNA. Validation studies and comparisons with existing methods suggest that incorporation of this protocol will reduce amplification bias in genome mapping experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {Several techniques, such as concatenation and consensus methods, are available for combining data from multiple loci to produce a single statement of phylogenetic relationships. However, when multiple alleles are sampled from individual species, it becomes more challenging to estimate relationships at the level of species, either because concatenation becomes inappropriate due to conflicts among individual gene trees, or because the species from which multiple alleles have been sampled may not form monophyletic groups in the estimated tree. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to reconstruct species trees from multiple-allele, multilocus sequence data, building on a recently proposed method for estimating species trees from single allele multilocus data. A two-step Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is adopted to estimate the posterior distribution of the species tree. The model is applied to estimate the posterior distribution of species trees for two multiple-allele datasets--yeast (Saccharomyces) and birds (Manacus-manakins). The estimates of the species trees using our method are consistent with those inferred from other methods and genetic markers, but in contrast to other species tree methods, it provides credible regions for the species tree. The Bayesian approach described here provides a powerful framework for statistical testing and integration of population genetics and phylogenetics.},

  Abstract                 = {We review recent models to estimate phylogenetic trees under the multispecies coalescent. Although the distinction between gene trees and species trees has come to the fore of phylogenetics, only recently have methods been developed that explicitly estimate species trees. Of the several factors that can cause gene tree heterogeneity and discordance with the species tree, deep coalescence due to random genetic drift in branches of the species tree has been modeled most thoroughly. Bayesian approaches to estimating species trees utilizes two likelihood functions, one of which has been widely used in traditional phylogenetics and involves the model of nucleotide substitution, and the second of which is less familiar to phylogeneticists and involves the probability distribution of gene trees given a species tree. Other recent parametric and nonparametric methods for estimating species trees involve parsimony criteria, summary statistics, supertree and consensus methods. Species tree approaches are an appropriate goal for systematics, appear to work well in some cases where concatenation can be misleading, and suggest that sampling many independent loci will be paramount. Such methods can also be challenging to implement because of the complexity of the models and computational time. In addition, further elaboration of the simplest of coalescent models will be required to incorporate commonly known issues such as deviation from the molecular clock, gene flow and other genetic forces.},

Many existing inference methods are based on predefined simplified population models, which are more suitable for hypothesis testing than exploratory analysis. We developed a novel model-flexible method called stairway plot, which infers changes in population size over time using SNP frequency spectra. This method is applicable for whole-genome sequences of hundreds of individuals. Using extensive simulation, we demonstrate the usefulness of the method for inferring demographic history, especially recent changes in population size. We apply the method to the whole-genome sequence data of 9 populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and show a pattern of fluctuations in human populations from 10,000 to 200,000 years ago.},

We previously reported that the Prestin gene has undergone sequence convergence among unrelated lineages of echolocating bat [3]. Here we report that this gene has also undergone convergent amino acid substitutions in echolocating dolphins, which group with echolocating bats in a phylogenetic tree of Prestin. Furthermore, we find evidence that these changes were driven by natural selection.},

  Abstract                 = {Intrinsic post-zygotic isolation is thought to result primarily from negative epistatic interactions between alleles at different loci from divergent populations (the Dobzhansky-Muller model). Uncovering the nature of these incompatible interactions and identifying the genes involved will enable a better understanding of the mechanisms and processes that lead to speciation. Although significant progress in this area has been made using Drosophila, a wide range of taxa must be studied before a full appreciation of the genetic basis of post-zygotic isolation is achieved. The well-documented Pyrenean hybrid zone between Chorthippus parallelus parallelus and C. p. erythropus was used as a model system to dissect the genetic basis of hybrid male sterility. Suppression subtractive hybridization was employed to identify genes that differ in testes expression between the two subspecies. This approach requires no prior sequence information and is widely applicable to nonmodel taxa. Twenty-one clones identified here show differential expression and represent candidate sterility genes. One of these candidates showed reduced introgression across the hybrid zone relative to neutral expectations. Testis follicle lengths in backcross males fit into two distinct classes, implying that few genes of major effect are contributing to sterility. This distinction is supported by a more direct measure of reproductive fitness, the number of sperm transferred during mating. Two candidate genes showed evidence of an association with sterility in backcrosses. No evidence for a reduction in testes size at the centre of the hybrid zone was detected. The findings contrast with a substantial body of work implying that generally, many D-M incompatibilities contribute to post-zygotic isolation. However, unlike many of the species investigated in these studies, the two subspecies examined in the present study are in the early stages of divergence and display incomplete reproductive isolation. For these reasons, the results presented here may be more relevant to the question of how many, and which genes initially cause speciation.},

We sequenced the exomes of 1,000 Danish cases with common forms of type 2 diabetes (including body mass index > 27.5 kg/m(2) and hypertension) and 1,000 healthy controls to an average depth of 56×. Our simulations suggest that our study had the statistical power to detect at least one causal gene (a gene containing causal mutations) if the heritability of these common diseases was explained by rare variants in the coding regions of a limited number of genes. We applied a series of gene-based tests to detect such susceptibility genes. However, no gene showed a significant association with disease risk after we corrected for the number of genes analyzed. Thus, we could reject a model for the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes where rare nonsynonymous variants clustered in a modest number of genes (fewer than 20) are responsible for the majority of disease risk.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies of the routes of worldwide introductions of alien organisms suggest that many widespread invasions could have stemmed not from the native range, but from a particularly successful invasive population, which serves as the source of colonists for remote new territories. We call here this phenomenon the invasive bridgehead effect. Evaluating the likelihood of such a scenario is heuristically challenging. We solved this problem by using approximate Bayesian computation methods to quantitatively compare complex invasion scenarios based on the analysis of population genetics (microsatellite variation) and historical (first observation dates) data. We applied this approach to the Harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis (HA), a coccinellid native to Asia that was repeatedly introduced as a biocontrol agent without becoming established for decades. We show that the recent burst of worldwide invasions of HA followed a bridgehead scenario, in which an invasive population in eastern North America acted as the source of the colonists that invaded the European, South American and African continents, with some admixture with a biocontrol strain in Europe. This demonstration of a mechanism of invasion via a bridgehead has important implications both for invasion theory (i.e., a single evolutionary shift in the bridgehead population versus multiple changes in case of introduced populations becoming invasive independently) and for ongoing efforts to manage invasions by alien organisms (i.e., heightened vigilance against invasive bridgeheads).},

The native area of invasive species may be large, poorly known and/or genetically structured. Because the actual source population may not have been sampled, studies based on molecular markers may generate incorrect conclusions about the origin of introduced populations. In this study, we characterized the genetic structure of the invasive ladybird Harmonia axyridis in its native area using various population genetic statistics and methods. We found that native area of H.¬†axyridis most probably consisted of two geographically distinct genetic clusters located in eastern and western Asia. We then performed approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) analyses on controlled simulated microsatellite data sets to evaluate (i) the risk of selecting incorrect introduction scenarios, including admixture between sources, when the populations of the native area are genetically structured and sampling is incomplete and (ii) the ability of ABC analysis to minimize such risks by explicitly including unsampled populations in the scenarios compared. Finally, we performed additional ABC analyses on real microsatellite data sets to retrace the origin of biocontrol and invasive populations of H.¬†axyridis, taking into account the possibility that the structured native area may have been incompletely sampled. We found that the invasive population in eastern North America, which has served as the bridgehead for worldwide invasion by H.¬†axyridis, was probably formed by an admixture between the eastern and western native clusters. This admixture may have facilitated adaptation of the bridgehead population.},

Power is estimated as a function of realistic parameters expected to affect the likelihood of detecting a significant association: the number of SNPs examined, the scaled recombination size of the region examined, the proportion of variance in the trait attributable to a hidden causative polymorphism within the region, and the number of individuals or families examined. For the different combinations of parameter values, power is estimated from a large number of realizations of a simulated coalescent describing a single random mating population with mutation, random genetic drift, and recombination. This explicit population genetics model results in a distribution of DNA marker heterozygosities and linkage disequilibria that are likely to resemble those expected in actual population samples. The study concludes that (1) marker-based permutation tests are more powerful than simple haplotype-based tests, (2) there is sufficient power to detect the presence of causative polymorphisms of small effect if on the order of 500 individuals are sampled, (3) greater power is achieved by increasing the sample size than by increasing the number of polymorphisms, (4) association studies are generally more powerful than transmission disequilibrium-based tests, and (5) for the range of parameters considered association studies have a low repeatability unless sample sizes are on the order of 500 individuals. Estimates of 4Nc for a number of gene regions and human populations will be of use in determining the density of SNPs that are likely to be required for successful association studies.},

However, the results of FISH experiments using 45S and 5S rDNA probes suggest that in both species the B chromosomes are most likely of autosomal origin. In R. brasiliensis, the B chromosome presented 5S rDNA but not 45S rDNA, in resemblance to the L(2), L(3), M(5) and S(11) autosomes, but the X chromosome lacks both rDNA families. In X. d. angulatus, 45S rDNAs is absent from the B chromosome, whereas the X chromosome contains one of the two 45S rDNA clusters in the genome. The occurrence of B chromosomes in all nine R. brasiliensis populations analyzed indicates that they are widely distributed in Northeastern Brazil, and the small amount of interpopulation variation found for B chromosome prevalence suggests the existence of high gene flow, presumably due to the abundance of this grasshopper species on several types of vegetation and its relatively high flight capability.},

To explore these issues, we compared 20 different sampling designs in equilibrium (i.e. island model and isolation by distance) and nonequilibrium (i.e. range expansion from one or two refugia) demographic histories in spatially heterogeneous environments. We simulated spatially complex landscapes, which allowed us to exploit local maxima and minima in the environment in 'pair' and 'transect' sampling strategies. We compared F(ST) outlier and genetic-environment association (GEA) methods for each of two approaches that control for population structure: with a covariance matrix or with latent factors. We show that while the relative power of two methods in the same category (F(ST) or GEA) depended largely on the number of individuals sampled, overall GEA tests had higher power in the island model and F(ST) had higher power under isolation by distance. In the refugia models, however, these methods varied in their power to detect local adaptation at weakly selected loci. At weakly selected loci, paired sampling designs had equal or higher power than transect or random designs to detect local adaptation. Our results can inform sampling designs for studies of local adaptation and have important implications for the interpretation of genome scans based on landscape data.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding how and why populations evolve is of fundamental importance to molecular ecology. Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), a popular reduced representation method, has ushered in a new era of genome-scale research for assessing population structure, hybridization, demographic history, phylogeography and migration. RADseq has also been widely used to conduct genome scans to detect loci involved in adaptive divergence among natural populations. Here, we examine the capacity of those RADseq-based genome scan studies to detect loci involved in local adaptation. To understand what proportion of the genome is missed by RADseq studies, we developed a simple model using different numbers of RAD-tags, genome sizes and extents of linkage disequilibrium (length of haplotype blocks). Under the best-case modelling scenario, we found that RADseq using six- or eight-base pair cutting restriction enzymes would fail to sample many regions of the genome, especially for species with short linkage disequilibrium. We then surveyed recent studies that have used RADseq for genome scans and found that the median density of markers across these studies was 4.08 RAD-tag markers per megabase (one marker per 245¬†kb). The length of linkage disequilibrium for many species is one to three orders of magnitude less than density of the typical recent RADseq study. Thus, we conclude that genome scans based on RADseq data alone, while useful for studies of neutral genetic variation and genetic population structure, will likely miss many loci under selection in studies of local adaptation.},

  Abstract                 = {Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a perennial grass that has been designated as an herbaceous model biofuel crop for the United States of America. To facilitate accelerated breeding programs of switchgrass, we developed both an association panel and linkage populations for genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS). All of the 840 individuals were then genotyped using genotyping by sequencing (GBS), generating 350 GB of sequence in total. As a highly heterozygous polyploid (tetraploid and octoploid) species lacking a reference genome, switchgrass is highly intractable with earlier methodologies of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery. To access the genetic diversity of species like switchgrass, we developed a SNP discovery pipeline based on a network approach called the Universal Network-Enabled Analysis Kit (UNEAK). Complexities that hinder single nucleotide polymorphism discovery, such as repeats, paralogs, and sequencing errors, are easily resolved with UNEAK. Here, 1.2 million putative SNPs were discovered in a diverse collection of primarily upland, northern-adapted switchgrass populations. Further analysis of this data set revealed the fundamentally diploid nature of tetraploid switchgrass. Taking advantage of the high conservation of genome structure between switchgrass and foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.), two parent-specific, synteny-based, ultra high-density linkage maps containing a total of 88,217 SNPs were constructed. Also, our results showed clear patterns of isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-ploidy in natural populations of switchgrass. Phylogenetic analysis supported a general south-to-north migration path of switchgrass. In addition, this analysis suggested that upland tetraploid arose from upland octoploid. All together, this study provides unparalleled insights into the diversity, genomic complexity, population structure, phylogeny, phylogeography, ploidy, and evolutionary dynamics of switchgrass.},

This approach can be applied to any species for which a draft or complete reference genome sequence is available. The new tools we have developed include methods for aligning reads, calling genotypes, and incorporating sample-specific sequencing error rates in the estimate of evolutionary parameters. When applied to 19 individuals from a total of 18 human populations, our approach allowed sampling regions that are largely overlapping across individuals and that are representative of the entire genome. The resequencing data were used to test the serial founder model of human dispersal and to estimate the time of the Out of Africa migration. Our results also represent the first attempt to provide a time frame for the colonization of Australia based on large-scale resequencing data.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an implementation of a recently introduced method for estimating the allele frequency spectrum under the diffusion approximation. For SNP frequency data from multiple populations, the method computes numerical solutions to the allele frequency spectrum (AFS) under a complex model that includes population splitting events, migration, population expansion and admixture. The solution to the diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) that mimics the evolutionary process is found by means of truncated polynomial expansions. In the absence of gene-flow, our computation of frequency spectra yields exact results. The results are compared to those which use a finite difference method and to forward diffusion simulations. In general, all the methods yield comparable results, although the polynomial-based approach is the most accurate in the weak-migration limit. Also, the economical use of memory attained by the polynomial expansions makes the study of models with four populations possible for the first time. The method was applied to a four-population model of the human expansion out of Africa and the peopling of the Americas, using the Environmental Genome Project (EGP) SNP database. Although our confidence intervals largely overlapped previous analyses of these data, some were significantly different. In particular, estimates of migration among African, European and Asian populations were considerably lower than in a previous study and the estimated time of migration out of Africa was earlier. The estimated time of founding of a human population outside of Africa was 52,000 years (95% confidence interval: 36,000 - 80,800 years).},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The existence of "ancient asexuals", taxa that have persisted for long periods of evolutionary history without sexual recombination, is both controversial and important for our understanding of the evolution and maintenance of sexual reproduction. A lack of sex has consequences not only for the ecology of the asexual organism but also for its genome. Several genetic signatures are predicted from long-term asexual (apomictic) reproduction including (i) large "allelic" sequence divergence (ii) lack of phylogenetic clustering of "alleles" within morphological species and (iii) decay and loss of genes specific to meiosis and sexual reproduction. These genetic signatures can be hard to assess since it is difficult to demonstrate the allelic nature of very divergent sequences, divergence levels may be complicated by processes such as inter-specific hybridization, and genes may have secondary roles unrelated to sexual reproduction. Apomictic species of Meloidogyne root knot nematodes have been suggested previously to be ancient asexuals. Their relatives reproduce by meiotic parthenogenesis or facultative sexuality, which in combination with the abundance of nematode genomic sequence data, makes them a powerful system in which to study the consequences of reproductive mode on genomic divergence. RESULTS: Here, sequences from nuclear protein-coding genes are used to demonstrate that the first two predictions of ancient asexuality are found within the apomictic root knot nematodes. Alleles are more divergent in the apomictic taxa than in those species exhibiting recombination and do not group phylogenetically according to recognized species. In contrast some nuclear alleles, and mtDNA, are almost identical across species. Sequencing of Major Sperm Protein, a gamete-specific gene, from both meiotic and ameiotic species reveals no increase in evolutionary rate nor change in substitution pattern in the apomictic taxa, indicating that the locus has been maintained by selection. CONCLUSION: The data strongly suggests the tropical root knot nematode apomicts have a recent origin and are not anciently asexual. The results support that interspecific hybridization has been involved in the origin of this asexual group and has played a role in shaping the patterns of genetic diversity observed. This study suggests that genetic signatures of ancient asexuality must be taken with caution due to the confounding effect of interspecific hybridization, which has long been implicated in the origins of apomictic species.},

  Abstract                 = {A 300 bp portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was used to investigate the intraspecific genetic structure of the European meadow grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus. Levels of genetic subdivision between geographical regions in Europe were assessed using the KST statistic and revealed patterns indicative of the postglacial history of this organism. Northern European populations are shown to share a very recent common ancestor with, and hence originate from, a Balkan expansion. Genetic distances between these areas and both southern Italy and central Spain are shown to be approximately equal, even though only the Spanish form is recognized as a distinct subspecies. Distance estimates indicate that the common ancestor of the two subspecies lived more than one glacial cycle ago, and the refugial populations have probably been diverging in isolation for five or six glacial cycles (approximately equal to 550,000 years). Comparisons are made to the analysis of a similar data set using an anonymous nuclear DNA marker (Cooper et al., 1995). Although the structure revealed is generally very similar, differences in the location of transition zones between different genetic forms of C. parallelus may reflect the different historical assortment of these molecules.},

Existing read mapping software excel in either speed (e.g., BWA, Bowtie, ELAND) or sensitivity (e.g., Novoalign), but not in both. In addition, performance often deteriorates in the presence of sequence variation, particularly so for short insertions and deletions (indels). Here, we present a read mapper, Stampy, which uses a hybrid mapping algorithm and a detailed statistical model to achieve both speed and sensitivity, particularly when reads include sequence variation. This results in a higher useable sequence yield and improved accuracy compared to that of existing software.},

  Abstract                 = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become the primary approach for identifying genes with common variants influencing complex diseases. Despite considerable progress, the common variations identified by GWAS account for only a small fraction of disease heritability and are unlikely to explain the majority of phenotypic variations of common diseases. A potential source of the missing heritability is the contribution of rare variants. Next-generation sequencing technologies will detect millions of novel rare variants, but these technologies have three defining features: identification of a large number of rare variants, a high proportion of sequence errors, and a large proportion of missing data. These features raise challenges for testing the association of rare variants with phenotypes of interest. In this study, we use a genome continuum model and functional principal components as a general principle for developing novel and powerful association analysis methods designed for resequencing data. We use simulations to calculate the type I error rates and the power of nine alternative statistics: two functional principal component analysis (FPCA)-based statistics, the multivariate principal component analysis (MPCA)-based statistic, the weighted sum (WSS), the variable-threshold (VT) method, the generalized T(2), the collapsing method, the CMC method, and individual tests. We also examined the impact of sequence errors on their type I error rates. Finally, we apply the nine statistics to the published resequencing data set from ANGPTL4 in the Dallas Heart Study. We report that FPCA-based statistics have a higher power to detect association of rare variants and a stronger ability to filter sequence errors than the other seven methods.},

  Abstract                 = {The role of natural selection in speciation has received increasing attention and support in recent years. Different types of approaches have been developed that can detect genomic regions influenced by selection. Here, we address the question whether two highly different methods-F(ST) outlier analysis and admixture analysis-detect largely the same set of non-neutral genomic elements or, instead, complementary sets. We study genetic architecture in a natural secondary contact zone where extensive admixture occurs. The marine bivalves Macoma balthica rubra and M. b. balthica descend from two independent trans-Arctic invasions of the north Atlantic and hybridize extensively where they meet, for example in the Kattegat-Danish Straits-Baltic Sea region. The Kattegat-Danish Straits region forms a steep salinity cline and is the only entrance to the recently (ca. 8000?years ago) established brackish water basin the Baltic Sea. Salinity along the contact zone drops from 30? (Skagerrak, M.b.rubra) to 3? (Baltic, M.b.balthica). Both outlier analysis and genomic clines analysis suggest that large parts of the genome are influenced by non-neutral effects. Contrasting samples from well outside the hybrid zone, outlier analysis detects 16 of 84 amplified fragment length polymorphism markers as significant F(ST) outliers. Genomic clines analysis detects 31 of 84 markers as non-neutral inside the hybrid zone. Remarkably, only three markers are detected by both methods. We conclude that the two methods together identify a suite of markers that are under the influence of non-neutral effects.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the mechanisms of evolution requires information on the rate of appearance of new mutations and their effects at the molecular and phenotypic levels. Although procuring such data has been technically challenging, high-throughput genome sequencing is rapidly expanding knowledge in this area. With information on spontaneous mutations now available in a variety of organisms, general patterns have emerged for the scaling of mutation rate with genome size and for the likely mechanisms that drive this pattern. Support is presented for the hypothesis that natural selection pushes mutation rates down to a lower limit set by the power of random genetic drift rather than by intrinsic physiological limitations, and that this has resulted in reduced levels of replication, transcription, and translation fidelity in eukaryotes relative to prokaryotes.},

However, because these new technologies are error prone and yield uneven coverage of alleles in diploid individuals, they also introduce the need for novel methods for analyzing the raw read data. A maximum-likelihood method for the estimation of allele frequencies is developed, eliminating both the need to arbitrarily discard individuals with low coverage and the requirement for an extrinsic measure of the sequence error rate. The resultant estimates are nearly unbiased with asymptotically minimal sampling variance, thereby defining the limits to our ability to estimate population-genetic parameters and providing a logical basis for the optimal design of population-genomic surveys.},

While offering unprecedented power for the acquisition of population-genetic parameters, these new methods also introduce a number of challenges, most notably the need to account for the binomial sampling of parental alleles at individual nucleotide sites and to eliminate bias from various sources of sequence errors. To minimize the effects of both problems, methods are developed for generating nearly unbiased and minimum-sampling-variance estimates of a number of key parameters, including the average nucleotide heterozygosity and its variance among sites, the pattern of decomposition of linkage disequilibrium with physical distance, and the rate and molecular spectrum of spontaneously arising mutations. These methods provide a general platform for the efficient utilization of data from population-genomic surveys, while also providing guidance for the optimal design of such studies.},

The changes include gradual increases in gene number, resulting from the retention of duplicate genes, and more abrupt increases in the abundance of spliceosomal introns and mobile genetic elements. We argue that many of these modifications emerged passively in response to the long-term population-size reductions that accompanied increases in organism size. According to this model, much of the restructuring of eukaryotic genomes was initiated by nonadaptive processes, and this in turn provided novel substrates for the secondary evolution of phenotypic complexity by natural selection. The enormous long-term effective population sizes of prokaryotes may impose a substantial barrier to the evolution of complex genomes and morphologies.},

  Abstract                 = {The spatial genetic composition of hybrid zones exhibits a range of possible patterns, with many characterized by patchy distributions. While several hypothetical explanations exist for the maintenance of these "mosaic" hybrid zones, they remain virtually unexplored theoretically. Using computer simulations we investigate the roles of dispersal and assortative mating in the formation and persistence of hybrid zone structure. To quantify mosaic structure we develop a likelihood method, which we apply to simulation and empirical data. We find that long distance dispersal can lead to a patchy distribution that assortative mating can then reinforce, ultimately producing a mosaic capable of persisting over evolutionarily significant periods of time. By reducing the mating success of rare males, assortative mating creates a positive within-patch frequency-dependent selective pressure. Selection against heterozygotes can similarly create a rare-type disadvantage and we show that it can also preserve structure. We find that mosaic structure is maintained across a range of assumptions regarding the form and strength of assortative mating. Interestingly, we find that higher levels of mosaic structure are sometimes observed for intermediate assortment strengths. The high incidence of assortment documented in hybrid zones suggests that it may play a key role in stabilizing their form and structure.},

The result is technically significant since <italic>Miscanthus</italic> has a very large and highly heterozygous genome, but has no or limited genomics information to date. The composite linkage map containing markers from both parental linkage maps is composed of 3,745 SNP markers spanning 2,396 cM on 19 linkage groups with a 0.64 cM average resolution. Comparative genomics analyses of the <italic>M. sinensis</italic> composite linkage map to the genomes of sorghum, maize, rice, and <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> indicate that sorghum has the closest syntenic relationship to <italic>Miscanthus</italic> compared to other species. The comparative results revealed that each pair of the 19 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> linkages aligned to one sorghum chromosome, except for LG8, which mapped to two sorghum chromosomes (4 and 7), presumably due to a chromosome fusion event after genome duplication. The data also revealed several other chromosome rearrangements relative to sorghum, including two telomere-centromere inversions of the sorghum syntenic chromosome 7 in LG8 of <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and two paracentric inversions of sorghum syntenic chromosome 4 in LG7 and LG8 of <italic>M. sinensis</italic>. The results clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that the diploid <italic>M. sinensis</italic> is tetraploid origin consisting of two sub-genomes. This complete and high resolution composite linkage map will not only serve as a useful resource for novel QTL discoveries, but also enable informed deployment of the wealth of existing genomics resources of other species to the improvement of <italic>Miscanthus</italic> as a high biomass energy crop. In addition, it has utility as a reference for genome sequence assembly for the forthcoming whole genome sequencing of the <italic>Miscanthus</italic> genus.</p>},

Its transcriptomic data provide invaluable information for molecular entomology and pave a way for the comparative research of other medically, agronomically, and ecologically relevant insects. We developed the first transcriptomic database of the locust (LocustDB), building necessary infrastructures to integrate, organize, and retrieve data that are either currently available or to be acquired in the future.DESCRIPTION:LocustDB currently hosts 45,474 high-quality EST sequences from the locust, which were assembled into 12,161 unigenes. It, through user-friendly web interfaces, allows investigators to freely access sequence data, including homologous/orthologous sequences, functional annotations, and pathway analysis, based on conserved orthologous groups (COG), gene ontology (GO), protein domain (InterPro), and functional pathways (KEGG). It also provides information from comparative analysis based on data from the migratory locust and five other invertebrate species, including the silkworm, the honeybee, the fruitfly, the mosquito and the nematode. The website address of LocustDB is http://locustdb.genomics.org.cn/ webcite.CONCLUSION:LocustDB starts with the first transcriptome information for an orthopteran and hemimetabolous insect and will be extended to provide a framework for incorporating in-coming genomic data of relevant insect groups and a workbench for cross-species comparative studies.},

  Abstract                 = {There is currently considerable interest in genetic analysis of quantitative traits such as blood pressure and body mass index. Despite the fact that these traits change throughout life they are commonly analyzed only at a single time point. The genetic basis of such traits can be better understood by collecting and effectively analyzing longitudinal data. Analyses of these data are complicated by the need to incorporate information from complex pedigree structures and genetic markers. We propose conducting longitudinal quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses on such data sets by using a flexible random regression estimation technique. The relationship between genetic effects at different ages is efficiently modeled using covariance functions (CFs). Using simulated data we show that the change in genetic effects over time can be well characterized using CFs and that including parameters to model the change in effect with age can provide substantial increases in power to detect QTL compared with repeated measure or univariate techniques. The asymptotic distributions of the methods used are investigated and methods for overcoming the practical difficulties in fitting CFs are discussed. The CF-based techniques should allow efficient multivariate analyses of many data sets in human and natural population genetics.},

  Abstract                 = {Multilocus hybrid zone (HZ) studies predate genomics by decades. The power of early methods is becoming apparent now large datasets are commonplace. Relating introgression along a chromosome to evolutionary process is challenging: while reduced introgression replaced with the hybrid index. We compare this, a recently proposed genomic clinesregions may indicate speciation genes, this pattern may be obscured by asymmetric introgression of linked invasive genes. Further, HZ movement may form salients and leave islands in its wake. Barton?s concordance was proposed 24 years ago for assessing introgression where geographic patterns are complex. The geographic axis of introgression is approach, and two-dimensional (2D) geographic analyses, for 24 X chromosome loci of 2873 mice from the central-European house mouse HZ. In 2D, 14 loci show linear contact, seven precisely matching previous studies. Four show introgression islands to the east of the zone, suggesting past westward zone movement, two show westward salients. Barton?s concordance both recovers and refines this information. A region of reduced introgression on the central X is supported, despite X centromere-proximal male-biased westward introgression matching a westward 2D geographic salient. Genomic clines results are consistent regarding introgression asymmetries, but otherwise more difficult to interpret. Evidence for genetic conflict is discussed.},

Major challenges for biology in the post-genome era are to map the molecular polymorphisms responsible for variation in medically, agriculturally, and evolutionarily important complex traits; and to determine their gene frequencies and their homozygous, heterozygous, epistatic, and pleiotropic effects in multiple environments. The ease with which QTL can be mapped to genomic intervals bounded by molecular markers belies the difficulty in matching the QTL to a genetic locus. The latter requires high-resolution recombination or linkage disequilibrium mapping to nominate putative candidate genes, followed by genetic and/or functional complementation and gene expression analyses. Complete genome sequences and improved technologies for polymorphism detection will greatly advance the genetic dissection of quantitative traits in model organisms, which will open avenues for exploration of homologous QTL in related taxa.},

Here we explore approaches to phylogenetic inference designed to consider retention and sorting of ancestral polymorphism. We examine how the reconstructability of a species (or population) phylogeny is affected by (a) the number of loci used to estimate the phylogeny and (b) the number of individuals sampled per species. Even in difficult cases with considerable incomplete lineage sorting (times between divergences less than 1 N(e) generations), we found the reconstructed species trees matched the "true" species trees in at least three out of five partitions, as long as a reasonable number of individuals per species were sampled. We also studied the tradeoff between sampling more loci versus more individuals. Although increasing the number of loci gives more accurate trees for a given sampling effort with deeper species trees (e.g., total depth of 10 N(e) generations), sampling more individuals often gives better results than sampling more loci with shallower species trees (e.g., depth = 1 N(e)). Taken together, these results demonstrate that gene sequences retain enough signal to achieve an accurate estimate of phylogeny despite widespread incomplete lineage sorting. Continued improvement in our methods to reconstruct phylogeny near the species level will require a shift to a compound model that considers not only nucleotide or character state substitutions, but also the population genetics processes of lineage sorting.

Because hybrid incompatibilities are caused by divergence in each of the hybridizing species, they also reveal genomic changes occurring on short evolutionary time scales that have functional consequences. These changes include divergence in protein-coding gene sequence, structure, and location, as well as divergence in noncoding DNAs. The most important unresolved issue is understanding the evolutionary causes of the divergence within species that in turn leads to incompatibility between species. Surprisingly, much of this divergence does not appear to be driven by ecological adaptation but may instead result from responses to purely mutational mechanisms or to internal genetic conflicts. },

  Abstract                 = {Species are generally viewed by evolutionists as ârealâ distinct entities in nature, making speciation appear difficult. Charles Darwin had originally promoted a very different uniformitarian view that biological species were continuous with âvarietiesâ below the level of species and became distinguishable from them only when divergent natural selection led to gaps in the distribution of morphology. This Darwinian view on species came under immediate attack, and the consensus among evolutionary biologists today appears to side more with the ideas of Ernst Mayr and Theodosius Dobzhansky, who argued 70 years ago that Darwin was wrong about species. Here, I show how recent genetic studies of supposedly well-behaved animals, such as insects and vertebrates, including our own species, have supported the existence of the Darwinian continuum between varieties and species. Below the level of species, there are well-defined ecological races, while above the level of species, hybridization still occurs, and may often lead to introgression and, sometimes, hybrid speciation. This continuum is evident, not only across vast geographical regions, but also locally in sympatry. The existence of this continuum provides good evidence for gradual evolution of species from ecological races and biotypes, to hybridizing species and, ultimately, to species that no longer cross. Continuity between varieties and species not only provides an excellent argument against creationism, but also gives insight into the process of speciation. The lack of a hiatus between species and ecological races suggests that speciation may occur, perhaps frequently, in sympatry, and the abundant intermediate stages suggest that it is happening all around us. Speciation is easy!},

Here, I survey studies of natural interspecific hybridization in plants and a variety of animals. At least 25\% of plant species and 10\% of animal species, mostly the youngest species, are involved in hybridization and potential introgression with other species. Species in nature are often incompletely isolated for millions of years after their formation. Therefore, much evolution of eventual reproductive isolation can occur while nascent species are in gene-flow contact, in sympatry or parapatry, long after divergence begins. Although the relative importance of geographic isolation and gene flow in the origin of species is still unknown, many key processes involved in speciation, such as 'reinforcement' of post-mating isolation by the evolution of assortative mating, will have ample opportunity to occur in the presence of continuing gene flow. Today, DNA sequence data and other molecular methods are beginning to show that limited invasions of the genome are widespread, with potentially important consequences in evolutionary biology, speciation, biodiversity, and conservation.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: To understand speciation and the maintenance of taxa as separate entities, we need information about natural hybridization and gene flow among species. RESULTS: Interspecific hybrids occur regularly in Heliconius and Eueides (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) in the wild: 26-29\% of the species of Heliconiina are involved, depending on species concept employed. Hybridization is, however, rare on a per-individual basis. For one well-studied case of species hybridizing in parapatric contact (Heliconius erato and H. himera), phenotypically detectable hybrids form around 10\% of the population, but for species in sympatry hybrids usually form less than 0.05\% of individuals. There is a roughly exponential decline with genetic distance in the numbers of natural hybrids in collections, both between and within species, suggesting a simple "exponential failure law" of compatibility as found in some prokaryotes. CONCLUSION: Hybridization between species of Heliconius appears to be a natural phenomenon; there is no evidence that it has been enhanced by recent human habitat disturbance. In some well-studied cases, backcrossing occurs in the field and fertile backcrosses have been verified in insectaries, which indicates that introgression is likely, and recent molecular work shows that alleles at some but not all loci are exchanged between pairs of sympatric, hybridizing species. Molecular clock dating suggests that gene exchange may continue for more than 3 million years after speciation. In addition, one species, H. heurippa, appears to have formed as a result of hybrid speciation. Introgression may often contribute to adaptive evolution as well as sometimes to speciation itself, via hybrid speciation. Geographic races and species that coexist in sympatry therefore form part of a continuum in terms of hybridization rates or probability of gene flow. This finding concurs with the view that processes leading to speciation are continuous, rather than sudden, and that they are the same as those operating within species, rather than requiring special punctuated effects or complete allopatry. Although not qualitatively distinct from geographic races, nor "real" in terms of phylogenetic species concepts or the biological species concept, hybridizing species of Heliconius are stably distinct in sympatry, and remain useful groups for predicting morphological, ecological, behavioural and genetic characteristics.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Sympatric speciation remains controversial. âSympatryâ originally meant âin the same geographical areaâ. Recently, evolutionists have redefined âsympatric speciationâ non-spatially to require panmixia (mÂ =Â 0.5) between a pair of demes before onset of reproductive isolation. Although panmixia is a suitable starting point in models of speciation, it is not a useful definition of sympatry in natural populations, because it becomes virtually impossible to find or demonstrate sympatry in nature. The newer, non-spatial definition fails to address the classical debate about whether natural selection within a geographic overlap regularly causes speciation in nature, or whether complete geographic isolation is usually required. We therefore propose a more precise spatial definition by incorporating the population genetics of dispersal (or âcruising rangeâ). Sympatric speciation is considerably more likely under this spatial definition than under the demic definition, because distance itself has a powerful structuring effect, even over small spatial scales comparable to dispersal. Ecological adaptation in two-dimensional space often acts as a âmagic traitâ that causes pleiotropic reductions of gene flow. We provide examples from our own research.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The stingless bee genus Melipona has been divided into two groups, based on their heterochromatin content. Melipona quadrifasciata and Melipona rufiventris have low and high levels of heterochromatin, respectively. Since condensed chromatin may be rich in methylated DNA sequences, M. quadrifasciata and M. rufiventris nuclei may contain different amounts of methylated CpG. These differences could be assessed by comparing Feulgen-DNA values obtained by image analysis of cells treated with the restriction enzymes Msp I and Hpa II that distinguish between methylated and unmethylated DNA. Msp I and Hpa II cleave the sequence -CCGG-, but there is no cleavage by Hpa II if the cytosine of the central CG dinucleotide is methylated. METHODS: Malpighian tubules of M. quadrifasciata and M. rufiventris were treated with Msp I and Hpa II prior to the Feulgen reaction, and analyzed by automatic scanning microspectrophotometry. RESULTS: The Feulgen-DNA values for the heterochromatin of M. rufiventris and for the small heterochromatin and some euchromatin domains of M. quadrifasciata mostly decreased after treatment with Msp I, but were unchanged after treatment with Hpa II. CONCLUSION: CpG methylation, although detected in diverse chromatin compartments in different bee species, may induce silencing effects required for the same cell physiology.},

In this paper, we outline major challenges and future research directions for correlating environmental factors with molecular markers to identify adaptive genetic variation, and point to research gaps in the application of landscape genetics to real-world problems arising from global change, such as the ability of organisms to adapt over rapid time scales. High throughput sequencing generates vast quantities of molecular data to address the challenge of studying adaptive genetic variation in non-model species. Here, we suggest that improvements in the sampling design should consider spatial dependence among sampled individuals. Then, we describe available statistical approaches for integrating spatial dependence into landscape analyses of adaptive genetic variation.},

This is very useful, for example, in the field of conservation biology and evolutionary biology. Thanks to Next Generation Sequencing, genomic resources are growing exponentially, improving genome scan analyses in non-model species. Thousands of SNPs called using Reduced Representation Sequencing are increasingly used in genome scans. Besides, genome sequences are also becoming increasingly available, allowing better processing of short-read data, offering physical localization of variants, and improving haplotype reconstruction and data imputation. Ultimately, genome sequences are also becoming the raw material for selection inferences. Here, we discuss how the increasing availability of such genomic resources, notably genome sequences, influences the detection of signals of selection. Mainly, increasing data density and having the information of physical linkage data expand genome scans by (i) improving the overall quality of the data, (ii) helping the reconstruction of demographic history for the population studied to decrease false-positive rates and (iii) improving the statistical power of methods to detect the signal of selection. Of particular importance, the availability of a high-quality reference genome can improve the detection of the signal of selection by (i) allowing matching the potential candidate loci to linked coding regions under selection, (ii) rapidly moving the investigation to the gene and function and (iii) ensuring that the highly variable regions of the genomes that include functional genes are also investigated. For all those reasons, using reference genomes in genome scan analyses is highly recommended.},

This understanding is crucial, not only for improving ecological knowledge, but also for managing properly the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered populations. For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have investigated how physiognomy and other landscape features have influenced genetic variation within and between populations. They have relied on sampling populations that have been identified beforehand because most population genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a new approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and individual levels, and has implications for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. It differs from other genetic approaches, such as phylogeography, in that it tends to focus on processes at finer spatial and temporal scales. Here, we discuss, from a population genetic perspective, the current tools available for conducting studies of landscape genetics.},

  Abstract                 = {Computer simulations in which selection acts on a quantitative character show that the randomness of mutations can contribute significantly to evolutionary divergence between populations. In different populations, different advantageous mutations occur, and are selected to fixation, so that the populations diverge even when they are initially identical, and are subject to identical selection. This stochastic process is distinct from random genetic drift. In some circumstances (large populations or strong selection, or both) mutational order can be greatly more important than random drift in bringing about divergence. It can generate a `disconnection' between evolution at the phenotypic and genotypic levels, and can give rise to a rough `molecular clock', albeit episodic, that is driven by selection. In the absence of selection, mutational order has little or no effect.},

  Abstract                 = {The grasshopper Eyprepocnemis plorans subsp. plorans harbors a very widespread polymorphism for supernumerary (B) chromosomes which appear to have arisen recently. These chromosomes behave as genomic parasites because they are harmful for the individuals carrying them and show meiotic drive in the initial stages of population invasion. The rapid increase in B chromosome frequency at intrapopulation level is thus granted by meiotic drive, but its spread among populations most likely depends on interpopulation gene flow. We analyze here the population genetic structure in 10 natural populations from two regions (in the south and east) of the Iberian Peninsula. The southern populations were coastal whereas the eastern ones were inland populations located at 260-655 m altitude. The analysis of 97 ISSR markers revealed significant genetic differentiation among populations (average G(ST) = 0.129), and the Structure software and AMOVA indicated a significant genetic differentiation between southern and eastern populations. There was also significant isolation by distance (IBD) between populations. Remarkably, these results were roughly similar to those found when only the markers showing low or no dropout were included, suggesting that allelic dropout had negligible effects on population genetic analysis. We conclude that high gene flow helped this parasitic B chromosome to spread through most of the geographical range of the subspecies E. plorans plorans.},

  Abstract                 = {Instances of hybridization between mammalian taxa in the wild are rarely documented. To test for introgression between sibling species of horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus yunanensis and R. pearsoni) and two subspecies of the latter (R. p. pearsoni and R. p. chinensis), we sequenced two mtDNA and two ncDNA markers in individuals sampled from multiple localities within their overlapping ranges. The interspecific mtDNA gene tree corresponded to the expected taxonomic divisions, and coalescent-based analyses suggested divergence occurred around 4 MYA. However, these relationships strongly conflicted with those recovered from two independent nuclear gene trees, in which R. yunanensis clustered with R. p. pearsoni to the exclusion of R. p. chinensis. This geographically widespread discordance is best explained by large-scale historical introgression of ncDNA from R. yunanensis to R. pearsoni by male-mediated exchange in mixed species colonies during Pleistocene glacial periods, when ranges may have contracted and overlapped more than at present. Further species tree-gene tree conflicts were detected between R. p. pearsoni and R. p. chinensis, also indicating past and/or current introgression in their overlapping regions. However, here the patterns point to asymmetric mtDNA introgression without ncDNA introgression. Analyses of coalescence times indicate this exchange has occurred subsequent to the divergence of these subspecies from their common ancestor. Our work highlights the importance of using multiple data sets for reconstructing phylogeographic histories and resolving taxonomic relationships.},

New model-based population genetic methods can resolve complex demographic histories, but many studies in fields such as landscape genetics continue to rely on simple rules of thumb focused on gene flow to explain patterns of spatial differentiation. Here, we show how methods that use gene genealogies can reveal cryptic demographic histories and provide better estimates of gene flow with other parameters that contribute to genetic variation across landscapes and seascapes. We advocate for the expanded use and development of methods that consider spatial differentiation as the product of multiple forces interacting over time, and caution against a routine reliance on post-hoc gene flow interpretations.},

In the face of hybridization, few genomic regions may exhibit reciprocal monophyly, and these regions, usually evolving rapidly under selection, may be important for the maintenance of species boundaries. In animals with internal fertilization, genes encoding seminal protein are candidate barrier genes. Recently diverged hybridizing species such as the ?eld crickets Gryllus ?rmus and G. pennsylvanicus, offer excellent opportunities to investigate the origins of barriers to gene exchange. These recently diverged species form a well-characterized hybrid zone, and share ancestral polymorphisms across the genome. We analyzed DNA sequence divergence for seminal protein loci, housekeeping loci, and mtDNA, using a combination of analytical approaches and extensive sampling across both species and the hybrid zone. We report discordant genealogical patterns and differential introgression rates across the genome. The most dramatic outliers, showing near-zero introgression and more structured species trees, are also the only two seminal protein loci under selection. These are candidate barrier genes with possible reproductive functions. We also use genealogical data to examine the demographic history of the ?eld crickets and the current structure of the hybrid zone.},

This includes the characterization of genome structural variation, episodic changes in the repeat landscape, differences in gene expression, new models regarding speciation, and the ephemeral nature of the recombination landscape. The functional characterization of genomic differences important in primate speciation and adaptation retrains a significant challenge. Limited access to biological materials, the lack of detailed phenotypic data and the endangered status of many critical primate species have significantly attenuated research into the genetic basis of primate evolution. Next-generation sequencing technologies promise to greatly expand the number of available primate genome sequences; however, such draft genome sequences will likely miss critical genetic differences within complex genomic regions unless dedicated efforts are put forward to understand the full spectrum of genetic variation. },

We mined these regions to produce 500,000 high-confidence SNP candidates as a uniform resource for describing nucleotide diversity and its regional variation within the genome. Distributions of marker density observed at different overlap length scales under a model of recombination and population size change show that the history of the population represented by the public genome sequence is one of collapse followed by a recent phase of mild size recovery. The inferred times of collapse and recovery are Upper Paleolithic, in agreement with archaeological evidence of the initial modern human colonization of Europe.},

For this analysis we derived a simple, closed mathematical formulation for the spectrum of expected allele frequencies when the sampled populations have experienced nonstationary demographic histories. The direct calculation generates the spectrum orders of magnitude faster than coalescent simulations do and allows us to generate spectra for a large number of alternative histories on a multidimensional parameter grid. Model-fitting experiments using this grid reveal significant population-specific differences among the demographic histories that best describe the observed allele frequency spectra. European and Asian spectra show a bottleneck-shaped history: a reduction of effective population size in the past followed by a recent phase of size recovery. In contrast, the African-American spectrum shows a history of moderate but uninterrupted population expansion. These differences are expected to have profound consequences for the design of medical association studies. The analytical methods developed for this study, i.e., a closed mathematical formulation for the allele frequency spectrum, correcting the ascertainment bias introduced by shallow SNP sampling, and dealing with variable sample sizes provide a general framework for the analysis of public variation data.},

The large volume of data produced by high-throughput sequencing projects is a rich and largely untapped source of SNPs (refs 2, 3, 4, 5). We present here a unified approach to the discovery of variations in genetic sequence data of arbitrary DNA sources. We propose to use the rapidly emerging genomic sequence as a template on which to layer often unmapped, fragmentary sequence data and to use base quality values to discern true allelic variations from sequencing errors. By taking advantage of the genomic sequence we are able to use simpler yet more accurate methods for sequence organization: fragment clustering, paralogue identification and multiple alignment. We analyse these sequences with a novel, Bayesian inference engine, POLYBAYES, to calculate the probability that a given site is polymorphic. Rigorous treatment of base quality permits completely automated evaluation of the full length of all sequences, without limitations on alignment depth. We demonstrate this approach by accurate SNP predictions in human ESTs aligned to finished and working-draft quality genomic sequences, a data set representative of the typical challenges of sequence-based SNP discovery.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing presents several statistical challenges, with one of the most fundamental being determining an individual's genotype from multiple aligned short read sequences at a position. Some simple approaches for genotype calling apply fixed filters, such as calling a heterozygote if more than a specified percentage of the reads have variant nucleotide calls. Other genotype-calling methods, such as MAQ and SOAPsnp, are implementations of Bayes classifiers in that they classify genotypes using posterior genotype probabilities.Here, we propose a novel genotype-calling algorithm that, in contrast to the other methods, estimates parameters underlying the posterior probabilities in an adaptive way rather than arbitrarily specifying them a priori. The algorithm, which we call SeqEM, applies the well-known Expectation-Maximization algorithm to an appropriate likelihood for a sample of unrelated individuals with next-generation sequence data, leveraging information from the sample to estimate genotype probabilities and the nucleotide-read error rate. We demonstrate using analytic calculations and simulations that SeqEM results in genotype-call error rates as small as or smaller than filtering approaches and MAQ. We also apply SeqEM to exome sequence data in eight related individuals and compare the results to genotypes from an Illumina SNP array, showing that SeqEM behaves well in real data that deviates from idealized assumptions.SeqEM offers an improved, robust and flexible genotype-calling approach that can be widely applied in the next-generation sequencing studies.Software for SeqEM is freely available from our website: www.hihg.org under Software Download.},

While high throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for addressing these problems, its success is dependent upon the availability and quality of reference genome sequences, thus limiting the organisms to which it can be applied.Here, we describe Rnnotator, an automated software pipeline that generates transcript models by de novo assembly of RNA-Seq data without the need for a reference genome. We have applied the Rnnotator assembly pipeline to two yeast transcriptomes and compared the results to the reference gene catalogs of these organisms. The contigs produced by Rnnotator are highly accurate (95\%) and reconstruct full-length genes for the majority of the existing gene models (54.3\%). Furthermore, our analyses revealed many novel transcribed regions that are absent from well annotated genomes, suggesting Rnnotator serves as a complementary approach to analysis based on a reference genome for comprehensive transcriptomics.These results demonstrate that the Rnnotator pipeline is able to reconstruct full-length transcripts in the absence of a complete reference genome.},

  Abstract                 = {We compared the published cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles of 78 ant species across 5 subfamilies. Almost 1,000 CHCs have been described for these species, composing 187 distinct homologous series and ten hydrocarbon groups. In descending order of occurrence were: n-alkanes > monomethylalkanes > dimethylalkanes > alkenes > dienes>> trimethylalkanes>> methylalkenes > methylalkadienes > trienes > tetramethylalkanes. Odd chain lengths and positions of methyl or double bonds at odd carbon numbers were far more numerous than even chain-length compounds or bond positions. Although each species possess its own unique pattern of CHCs, we found no association between CHC profile and phylogeny. The production of the biosynthetically complex compounds (e.g., methyl branched dienes) by the most primitive living ant suggests that the basic genetic architecture required to produce the rich diversity of CHCs was already present prior to their adaptive radiation. Unlike the ubiquitous n-alkanes and monomethylalkanes, there is a huge diversity of species-specific dimethylalkanes that makes them likely candidates for species and nest-mate discrimination signals.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerous recent studies have correlated cuticular hydrocarbon profiles with a wide range of behaviors, particularly in social insects. These findings are wholly or partly based on multivariate statistical methods such as discriminate analysis (DA) or principal component analysis (PCA). However, these methods often provide limited insight into the biological processes that generate the small differences usually detected. This may be a consequence of variability in the system due to inadequate sample sizes and the assumption that all compounds are independent. A fundamental problem is that these methods combine rather than separate the effects of signal components. By using cuticular hydrocarbon data from previous social insect studies, we showed that: (1) in 13 species of Formica ants and seven species of Vespa hornets, at least one group of hydrocarbons in each species was highly (r(2) > 0.8) correlated, indicating that all compounds are not independent; (2) DA was better at group separation that PCA; (3) the relationships between colonies (chemical distance) were unstable and sensitive to variability in the system; and (4) minor compounds had a disproportionately large effect on the analysis. All these factors, along with sample size, need to be considered in the future analysis of complex chemical profiles.},

WGS assemblies can be constructed with comparative ease and give a comprehensive representation of the gene space even of large and complex genomes. One major obstacle in utilizing WGS assemblies for important research applications such as gene isolation or comparative genomics has been the lack of chromosomal positioning and contextualization of short sequence contigs. Assigning chromosomal locations to sequence contigs required the construction and integration of genome-wide physical maps and dense genetic linkage maps as well as synteny to model species. Recently, methods to rapidly construct ultra-dense linkage maps encompassing millions of genetic markers from WGS sequencing data of segregating populations have made possible the direct assignment of genetic positions to short sequence contigs. Here, we review recent developments in the integration of WGS assemblies and sequence-based linkage maps, discuss challenges for further improvement of the methodology and outline possible applications building on genetically anchored WGS assemblies.},

To assess the global impact of animal miRNAs on gene regulation, the expression of predicted targets and their cognate miRNAs was extensively analyzed in mammals and Drosophila. In general, targets are co-expressed at relatively low or undetectable levels in the same tissues as the miRNAs predicted to regulate them. Additionally, genes that are highly co-expressed with miRNAs usually lack target sites. The authors conclude that many animal genes are under evolutionary pressure to maintain or avoid complementary sites to miRNAs. Thus, the miRNA pathway broadly contributes to the complex gene regulatory networks that shape animal tissue development and identity.},

  Abstract                 = {Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) provides researchers with the ability to record genetic polymorphism across thousands of loci for nonmodel organisms, potentially revolutionizing the field of molecular ecology. However, as with other genotyping methods, RADseq is prone to a number of sources of error that may have consequential effects for population genetic inferences, and these have received only limited attention in terms of the estimation and reporting of genotyping error rates. Here we use individual sample replicates, under the expectation of identical genotypes, to quantify genotyping error in the absence of a reference genome. We then use sample replicates to (i) optimize de novo assembly parameters within the program Stacks, by minimizing error and maximizing the retrieval of informative loci; and (ii) quantify error rates for loci, alleles and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. As an empirical example, we use a double-digest RAD data set of a nonmodel plant species, Berberis alpina, collected from high-altitude mountains in Mexico.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate and fast estimation of genetic parameters that underlie quantitative traits using mixed linear models with additive and dominance effects is of great importance in both natural and breeding populations. Here, we propose a new fast adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm for the estimation of genetic parameters in the linear mixed model with several random effects. In the learning phase of our algorithm, we use the hybrid Gibbs sampler to learn the covariance structure of the variance components. In the second phase of the algorithm, we use this covariance structure to formulate an effective proposal distribution for a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which uses a likelihood function in which the random effects have been integrated out. Compared with the hybrid Gibbs sampler, the new algorithm had better mixing properties and was approximately twice as fast to run. Our new algorithm was able to detect different modes in the posterior distribution. In addition, the posterior mode estimates from the adaptive MCMC method were close to the REML (residual maximum likelihood) estimates. Moreover, our exponential prior for inverse variance components was vague and enabled the estimated mode of the posterior variance to be practically zero, which was in agreement with the support from the likelihood (in the case of no dominance). The method performance is illustrated using simulated data sets with replicates and field data in barley.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to infer the parameters of positive selection from genomic data has many important implications, from identifying drug-resistance mutations in viruses to increasing crop yield by genetically integrating favorable alleles. Although it has been well-described that selection and demography may result in similar patterns of diversity, the ability to jointly estimate these two processes has remained elusive. Here we use simulation to explore the utility of the joint site frequency spectrum to estimate selection and demography simultaneously, including developing an extension of the previously proposed Jaatha program (Mathew et al., 2013). We evaluate both complete and incomplete selective sweeps under an isolation-with-migration model with and without population size change (both population growth and bottlenecks). Results suggest that while it may not be possible to precisely estimate the strength of selection, it is possible to infer the presence of selection while estimating accurate demographic parameters. We further demonstrate that the common assumption of selective neutrality when estimating demographic models may lead to severe biases. Finally, we apply the approach we have developed to better characterize the within-host demographic and selective history of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection using published next generation sequencing data.},

  Abstract                 = {Copy number variation is an important component of genetic variation in higher eukaryotes. The extent of natural copy number variation in C. elegans is unknown outside of 2 highly divergent wild isolates and the canonical N2 Bristol strain.We have used array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to detect copy number variation in the genomes of 12 natural isolates of Caenorhabditis elegans. Deletions relative to the canonical N2 strain are more common in these isolates than duplications, and indels are enriched in multigene families on the autosome arms. Among the strains in our study, the Hawaiian and Madeiran strains (CB4856 and JU258) carry the largest number of deletions, followed by the Vancouver strain (KR314). Overall we detected 510 different deletions affecting 1136 genes, or over 5\% of the genes in the canonical N2 genome. The indels we identified had a median length of 2.7 kb. Since many deletions are found in multiple isolates, deletion loci were used as markers to derive an unrooted tree to estimate genetic relatedness among the strains.Copy number variation is extensive in C. elegans, affecting over 5\% of the genes in the genome. The deletions we have detected in natural isolates of C. elegans contribute significantly to the number of deletion alleles available to researchers. The relationships between strains are complex and different regions of the genome possess different genealogies due to recombination throughout the natural history of the species, which may not be apparent in studies utilizing smaller numbers of genetic markers.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary relationships among birds in Neoaves, the clade comprising the vast majority of avian diversity, have vexed systematists due to the ancient, rapid radiation of numerous lineages. We applied a new phylogenomic approach to resolve relationships in Neoaves using target enrichment (sequence capture) and high-throughput sequencing of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) in avian genomes. We collected sequence data from UCE loci for 32 members of Neoaves and one outgroup (chicken) and analyzed data sets that differed in their amount of missing data. An alignment of 1,541 loci that allowed missing data was 87\% complete and resulted in a highly resolved phylogeny with broad agreement between the Bayesian and maximum-likelihood (ML) trees. Although results from the 100\% complete matrix of 416 UCE loci were similar, the Bayesian and ML trees differed to a greater extent in this analysis, suggesting that increasing from 416 to 1,541 loci led to increased stability and resolution of the tree. Novel results of our study include surprisingly close relationships between phenotypically divergent bird families, such as tropicbirds (Phaethontidae) and the sunbittern (Eurypygidae) as well as between bustards (Otididae) and turacos (Musophagidae). This phylogeny bolsters support for monophyletic waterbird and landbird clades and also strongly supports controversial results from previous studies, including the sister relationship between passerines and parrots and the non-monophyly of raptorial birds in the hawk and falcon families. Although significant challenges remain to fully resolving some of the deep relationships in Neoaves, especially among lineages outside the waterbirds and landbirds, this study suggests that increased data will yield an increasingly resolved avian phylogeny.},

  Abstract                 = {This is a time of unprecedented transition in DNA sequencing technologies. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) clearly holds promise for fast and cost-effective generation of multilocus sequence data for phylogeography and phylogenetics. However, the focus on non-model organisms, in addition to uncertainty about which sample preparation methods and analyses are appropriate for different research questions and evolutionary timescales, have contributed to a lag in the application of NGS to these fields. Here, we outline some of the major obstacles specific to the application of NGS to phylogeography and phylogenetics, including the focus on non-model organisms, the necessity of obtaining orthologous loci in a cost-effective manner, and the predominate use of gene trees in these fields. We describe the most promising methods of sample preparation that address these challenges. Methods that reduce the genome by restriction digest and manual size selection are most appropriate for studies at the intraspecific level, whereas methods that target specific genomic regions (i.e., target enrichment or sequence capture) have wider applicability from the population level to deep-level phylogenomics. Additionally, we give an overview of how to analyze NGS data to arrive at data sets applicable to the standard toolkit of phylogeography and phylogenetics, including initial data processing to alignment and genotype calling (both SNPs and loci involving many SNPs). Even though whole-genome sequencing is likely to become affordable rather soon, because phylogeography and phylogenetics rely on analysis of hundreds of individuals in many cases, methods that reduce the genome to a subset of loci should remain more cost-effective for some time to come.},

  Abstract                 = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are revolutionizing many biological disciplines but have been slow to take root in phylogeography. This is partly due to the difficulty of using NGS to sequence orthologous DNA fragments for many individuals at low cost. We explore cases of recent divergence in four phylogenetically diverse avian systems using a method for quick and cost-effective generation of primary DNA sequence data using pyrosequencing. NGS data were processed using an analytical pipeline that reduces many reads into two called alleles per locus per individual. Using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mined from the loci, we detected population differentiation in each of the four bird systems, including: a case of ecological speciation in rails (Rallus); a rapid postglacial radiation in the genus Junco; recent in situ speciation among hummingbirds (Trochilus) in Jamaica; and subspecies of white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) along the Pacific coast. The number of recovered loci aligning closely to chromosomal locations on the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) genome was highly correlated to the size of the chromosome, suggesting that loci are randomly distributed throughout the genome. Using eight loci found in Zonotrichia and Junco lineages, we were also able to generate a species tree of these sparrow sister genera, demonstrating the potential of this method for generating data amenable to coalescent-based analysis. We discuss improvements that should enhance the method's utility for primary data generation.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of molecular data from natural populations has allowed researchers to answer diverse ecological questions that were previously intractable. In particular, ecologists are often interested in the demographic history of populations, information that is rarely available from historical records. Methods have been developed to infer demographic parameters from genomic data, but it is not well understood how inferred parameters compare to true population history or depend on aspects of experimental design. Here, we present and evaluate a method of SNP discovery using RNA sequencing and demographic inference using the program Œ¥aŒ¥i, which uses a diffusion approximation to the allele frequency spectrum to fit demographic models. We test these methods in a population of the checkerspot butterfly Euphydryas gillettii. This population was intentionally introduced to Gothic, Colorado in 1977 and has as experienced extreme fluctuations including bottlenecks of fewer than 25 adults, as documented by nearly annual field surveys. Using RNA sequencing of eight individuals from Colorado and eight individuals from a native population in Wyoming, we generate the first genomic resources for this system. While demographic inference is commonly used to examine ancient demography, our study demonstrates that our inexpensive, all-in-one approach to marker discovery and genotyping provides sufficient data to accurately infer the timing of a recent bottleneck. This demographic scenario is relevant for many species of conservation concern, few of which have sequenced genomes. Our results are remarkably insensitive to sample size or number of genomic markers, which has important implications for applying this method to other nonmodel systems.},

If different species evolve distinct drive-suppressor systems, then hybrid progeny may be sterile as a result of negative interactions of these systems' components. Although the hypothesis that meiotic drive may contribute to hybrid sterility, and thus species formation, fell out of favour early in the 1990s, recent results showing an association between drive and sterility have resurrected this previously controversial idea. Here, we review the different forms of meiotic drive and their possible roles in speciation. We discuss the recent empirical evidence for a link between drive and hybrid male sterility, also suggesting a possible mechanistic explanation for this link in the context of chromatin remodelling. Finally, we revisit the population genetics of drive that allow it to contribute to speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:GemSIM, or General Error-Model based SIMulator, is a next-generation sequencing simulator capable of generating single or paired-end reads for any sequencing technology compatible with the generic formats SAM and FASTQ (including Illumina and Roche/454). GemSIM creates and uses empirically derived, sequence-context based error models to realistically emulate individual sequencing runs and/or technologies. Empirical fragment length and quality score distributions are also used. Reads may be drawn from one or more genomes or haplotype sets, facilitating simulation of deep sequencing, metagenomic, and resequencing projects.RESULTS:We demonstrate GemSIM's value by deriving error models from two different Illumina sequencing runs and one Roche/454 run, and comparing and contrasting the resulting error profiles of each run. Overall error rates varied dramatically, both between individual Illumina runs, between the first and second reads in each pair, and between datasets from Illumina and Roche/454 technologies. Indels were markedly more frequent in Roche/454 than Illumina and both technologies suffered from an increase in error rates near the end of each read.The effects of these different profiles on low-frequency SNP-calling accuracy were investigated by analysing simulated sequencing data for a mixture of bacterial haplotypes. In general, SNP-calling using VarScan was only accurate for SNPs with frequency > 3%, independent of which error model was used to simulate the data. Variation between error profiles interacted strongly with VarScan's 'minumum average quality' parameter, resulting in different optimal settings for different sequencing runs.CONCLUSIONS:Next-generation sequencing has unprecedented potential for assessing genetic diversity, however analysis is complicated as error profiles can vary noticeably even between different runs of the same technology. Simulation with GemSIM can help overcome this problem, by providing insights into the error profiles of individual sequencing runs and allowing researchers to assess the effects of these errors on downstream data analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most influential observations in molecular evolution has been a strong association between local recombination rate and nucleotide polymorphisms across the genome. This is interpreted as evidence for ubiquitous natural selection. The alternative explanation, that recombination is mutagenic, has been rejected by the absence of a similar association between local recombination rate and nucleotide divergence between species. However, many recent studies show that recombination rates are often very different even in closely related species, questioning whether an association between recombination rate and divergence between species has been tested satisfactorily. To circumvent this problem, we directly surveyed recombination across approximately 43\% of the D. pseudoobscura physical genome in two separate recombination maps and 31\% of the D. miranda physical genome, and we identified both global and local differences in recombination rate between these two closely related species. Using only regions with conserved recombination rates between and within species and accounting for multiple covariates, our data support the conclusion that recombination is positively related to diversity because recombination modulates Hill-Robertson effects in the genome and not because recombination is predominately mutagenic. Finally, we find evidence for dips in diversity around nonsynonymous substitutions. We infer that at least some of this reduction in diversity resulted from selective sweeps and examine these dips in the context of recombination rate.},

  Abstract                 = {One central, and yet unsolved, question in evolutionary biology is the relationship between the genetic variants segregating within species and the causes of morphological differences between species. The classic neo-darwinian view postulates that species differences result from the accumulation of small-effect changes at multiple loci. However, many examples support the possible role of larger abrupt changes in the expression of developmental genes in morphological evolution. Although this evidence might be considered a challenge to a neo-darwinian micromutationist view of evolution, there are currently few examples of the actual genes causing morphological differences between species. Here we examine the genetic basis of a trichome pattern difference between Drosophila species, previously shown to result from the evolution of a single gene, shavenbaby (svb), probably through cis-regulatory changes. We first identified three distinct svb enhancers from D. melanogaster driving reporter gene expression in partly overlapping patterns that together recapitulate endogenous svb expression. All three homologous enhancers from D. sechellia drive expression in modified patterns, in a direction consistent with the evolved svb expression pattern. To test the influence of these enhancers on the actual phenotypic difference, we conducted interspecific genetic mapping at a resolution sufficient to recover multiple intragenic recombinants. This functional analysis revealed that independent genetic regions upstream of svb that overlap the three identified enhancers are collectively required to generate the D. sechellia trichome pattern. Our results demonstrate that the accumulation of multiple small-effect changes at a single locus underlies the evolution of a morphological difference between species. These data support the view that alleles of large effect that distinguish species may sometimes reflect the accumulation of multiple mutations of small effect at select genes.},

PVC prokaryotes do not possess a nucleus and are not intermediates in the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition.

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

  Abstract                 = {A principal challenge in testing the role of natural selection in speciation is to connect the build-up of reproductive isolation between populations to divergence of ecologically important traits. Demonstrations of 'parallel speciation', or assortative mating by selective environment, link ecology and isolation, but the phenotypic traits mediating isolation have not been confirmed. Here we show that the parallel build-up of mating incompatibilities between stickleback populations can be largely accounted for by assortative mating based on one trait, body size, which evolves predictably according to environment. In addition to documenting the influence of body size on reproductive isolation for stickleback populations spread across the Northern Hemisphere, we have confirmed its importance through a new experimental manipulation. Together, these results suggest that speciation may arise largely as a by-product of ecological differences and divergent selection on a small number of phenotypic traits.},

However, while the method is often used to inform about historical demographic processes, little is known about the relationship between fundamental demographic parameters and the projection of samples onto the primary axes. Here I show that for SNP data the projection of samples onto the principal components can be obtained directly from considering the average coalescent times between pairs of haploid genomes. The result provides a framework for interpreting PCA projections in terms of underlying processes, including migration, geographical isolation, and admixture. I also demonstrate a link between PCA and Wright's f(st) and show that SNP ascertainment has a largely simple and predictable effect on the projection of samples. Using examples from human genetics, I discuss the application of these results to empirical data and the implications for inference.},

  Abstract                 = {Selection acting on genomic functional elements can be detected by its indirect effects on population diversity at linked neutral sites. To illuminate the selective forces that shaped hominid evolution, we analyzed the genomic distributions of human polymorphisms and sequence differences among five primate species relative to the locations of conserved sequence features. Neutral sequence diversity in human and ancestral hominid populations is substantially reduced near such features, resulting in a surprisingly large genome average diversity reduction due to selection of 19-26% on the autosomes and 12-40% on the X chromosome. The overall trends are broadly consistent with "background selection'' or hitchhiking in ancestral populations acting to remove deleterious variants. Average selection is much stronger on exonic (both protein-coding and untranslated) conserved features than non-exonic features. Long term selection, rather than complex speciation scenarios, explains the large intragenomic variation in human/chimpanzee divergence. Our analyses reveal a dominant role for selection in shaping genomic diversity and divergence patterns, clarify hominid evolution, and provide a baseline for investigating specific selective events. },

Following an initial period of enthusiasm, interest in these models began to wane when theoretical studies seemed to show that the rapid evolution of ornaments would not occur if there were costs associated with female mate choice. Recent theoretical work has shown, however, that runaway evolution and other kinds of extensive diversification of ornaments and preferences can occur, even when female choice is costly. These new models highlight crucial parameters that profoundly influence evolutionary trajectories, but these parameters have been neglected in empirical studies. Here, we review quantitative genetic models of sexual selection with the aim of fostering communication and synergism between theoretical and empirical enterprises. We also point out several areas in which additional empirical work could distinguish between alternative models of evolution.},

Here we argue that recurrent genetic conflict over sex chromosome transmission is an important evolutionary force that has shaped a wide range of seemingly disparate phenomena including the epigenetic regulation of genes expressed in the germline, the distribution of genes in the genome, and the evolution of hybrid sterility between species.},

  Abstract                 = {Arthropods comprise the most diverse group of animals on earth and as such have been the subject of considerable evolutionary research. For example, much of our understanding of the genetic basis of evolutionary change is derived from the insect genus Drosophila, one of the most well-studied organisms in biology. Arthropods are also of tremendous economic importance as both providers and chief destroyers of food for human consumption. Thus, the genetic diversity of arthropods is of interest from both a pure research perspective and for practical economic reasons. The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method of genetic analysis, developed in the early and mid-1990s (Vos et al., 1995; Zabeau, 1992; Zabeau and Vos, 1993), offers a relatively new method for assessing genetic diversity and has been increasingly applied in studies of arthropods. Originally coined selective restriction fragment amplification (SRFA) (Zabeau and Vos, 1993), the method was renamed (Vos et al., 1995) presumably to reflect its similarity to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Since then, AFLPs have become a popular tool in both population genetics to estimate population parameters such as heterozygosity, F-statistics, migration rates, and genetic distances, as well as phylogenetics, to infer relationships among closely related taxa. In arthropods, AFLPs have been used to assess genetic variation both within and between species in various taxa including crustaceans, chelicerates, and insects, often yielding novel insights. In this chapter, we briefly describe the AFLP method and its strengths and limitations. We then discuss the use of AFLPs in surveys of arthropod diversity, highlighting the specific questions addressed using AFLPs. Finally, a section on experimental design and methods, based on research in our laboratory, is provided.},

Cryptic species are therefore thought to represent distinct genetic units, the boundaries of which are maintained by premating incompatibilities, specifically by receiver preferences for conspecific signals. Laupala cerasina and L. kohalensis are sympatric species of swordtail crickets endemic to the big island of Hawaii, that are distinguishable by differences in male courtship song. We first tested whether groupings hypothesized by acoustic similarity reflect genetic groupings, using AFLP data to estimate genetic relationships. Second, we tested whether genetic boundaries are maintained by female preferences for conspecific song characteristics. Phonotaxis trials were used to determine the extent of female preferences for conspecific male song. Results generally support both hypotheses, but suggest the presence of porous species boundaries.},

We used amplified fragment length polymorphisms to investigate further the relationships among species and populations in the cerasina species group.

Documentation of these tools is often sparse, or provided in a format that is impenetrable to most biologists without informatics background. This article introduces the major concepts behind repeat detecting software essential for informed tool selection.

  Abstract                 = {Herein we tested the repeatability of phylogenetic inference based on high throughput sequencing by increased taxon sampling using our previously published techniques in the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii in North America. We sampled 25 natural populations drawn from different localities nearby 21 previous collection localities and used these new data to construct a second, independent phylogeny, expressly to test the reproducibility of phylogenetic patterns. Comparison of trees between the two data sets based on both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood with Bayesian posterior probabilities showed close correspondence in the grouping of the most southern populations into clear clades. However, discrepancies emerged, particularly in the middle of W. smithii's current range near the previous maximum extent of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, especially concerning the most recent common ancestor to mountain and northern populations. Combining all 46 populations from both studies into a single maximum parsimony tree and taking into account the post-glacial historical biogeography of associated flora provided an improved picture of W. smithii's range expansion in North America. In a more general sense, we propose that extensive taxon sampling, especially in areas of known geological disruption is key to a comprehensive approach to phylogenetics that leads to biologically meaningful phylogenetic inference.},

  Abstract                 = {The swordlike exaggerated caudal fin extensions of male swordtails are conspicuous traits that are selected for through female choice. Swords are one of only few examples where the hypothesis of a pre-existing bias is believed to apply for the evolution of a male trait. Previous laboratory experiments demonstrated that females prefer males with longer swords and even females from some swordless species show an affiliation for males of sworded species. Earlier phylogenetic studies based on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA placed the sworded southern swordtail Xiphophorus clemenciae with swordless platies, contradicting its morphology-based evolutionary affinities. The analyses of new nuclear DNA markers now recover its traditional phylogenetic placement with other southern swordtails, suggesting that this species was formed by an ancient hybridization event. We propose that sexual selection through female choice was the likely process of hybrid speciation, by mating of platy females with males of an ancestral swordtail lineage. In artificial crosses of descendent species from the two potential ancestral lineages of X. clemenciae the hybrid and backcross males have swords of intermediate lengths. Additionally, mate choice experiments demonstrate that hybrid females prefer sworded males. These experimental lines of evidence make hybridization through xeno-specific sexual selection by female choice the likely mechanism of speciation.},

These epigenetic changes can be associated with transcriptional activation and mobilization of transposable elements in hybrids. It raises a question of how these alterations are matched by small regulatory RNAs, such as piwi-interacting RNAs, which play a potent role in both suppressing transposable elements and epigenetic control.

  Abstract                 = {Speciation with gene flow is expected to generate a heterogeneous pattern of genomic differentiation. The few genes under or physically linked to loci experiencing strong disruptive selection can diverge, whereas gene flow will homogenize the remainder of the genome, resulting in isolated "genomic islands of speciation." We conducted an experimental test of this hypothesis in Rhagoletis pomonella, a model for sympatric ecological speciation. Contrary to expectations, we found widespread divergence throughout the Rhagoletis genome, with the majority of loci displaying host differences, latitudinal clines, associations with adult eclosion time, and within-generation responses to selection in a manipulative overwintering experiment. The latter two results, coupled with linkage disequilibrium analyses, provide experimental evidence that divergence was driven by selection on numerous independent genomic regions rather than by genome-wide genetic drift. "Continents" of multiple differentiated loci, rather than isolated islands of divergence, may characterize even the early stages of speciation. Our results also illustrate how these continents can exhibit variable topography, depending on selection strength, availability of preexisting genetic variation, linkage relationships, and genomic features that reduce recombination. For example, the divergence observed throughout the Rhagoletis genome was clearly accentuated in some regions, such as those harboring chromosomal inversions. These results highlight how the individual genes driving speciation can be embedded within an actively diverging genome.},

  Abstract                 = {Phenotypically diverse Lake Malawi cichlids exhibit similar genomes. The extensive sharing of genetic polymorphism among forms has both intrigued and frustrated biologists trying to understand the nature of diversity in this and other rapidly evolving systems. Shared polymorphism might result from hybridization and/or the retention of ancestrally polymorphic alleles. To examine these alternatives, we used new genomic tools to characterize genetic differentiation in widespread, geographically structured populations of Labeotropheus fuelleborni and Metriaclima zebra. These phenotypically distinct species share mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes and show greater mtDNA differentiation among localities than between species. However, Bayesian analysis of nuclear single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data revealed two distinct genetic clusters corresponding perfectly to morphologically diagnosed L. fuelleborni and M. zebra. This result is a function of the resolving power of the multi-locus dataset, not a conflict between nuclear and mitochondrial partitions. Locus-by-locus analysis showed that mtDNA differentiation between species (F-CT) was nearly identical to the median single-locus SNP F-CT. Finally, we asked whether there is evidence for gene flow at sites of co-occurrence. We used simulations to generate a null distribution for the level of differentiation between co-occurring populations of L. fuelleborni and M. zebra expected if there was no hybridization. The null hypothesis was rejected for the SNP data; populations that co-occur at rock reef sites were slightly more similar than expected by chance, suggesting recent gene flow.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:The generation and analysis of high-throughput sequencing data are becoming a major component of many studies in molecular biology and medical research. Illumina's Genome Analyzer (GA) and HiSeq instruments are currently the most widely used sequencing devices. Here, we comprehensively evaluate properties of genomic HiSeq and GAIIx data derived from two plant genomes and one virus, with read lengths of 95 to 150 bases.RESULTS:We provide quantifications and evidence for GC bias, error rates, error sequence context, effects of quality filtering, and the reliability of quality values. By combining different filtering criteria we reduced error rates 7-fold at the expense of discarding 12.5% of alignable bases. While overall error rates are low in HiSeq data we observed regions of accumulated wrong base calls. Only 3% of all error positions accounted for 24.7% of all substitution errors. Analyzing the forward and reverse strands separately revealed error rates of up to 18.7%. Insertions and deletions occurred at very low rates on average but increased to up to 2% in homopolymers. A positive correlation between read coverage and GC content was found depending on the GC content range.CONCLUSIONS:The errors and biases we report have implications for the use and the interpretation of Illumina sequencing data. GAIIx and HiSeq data sets show slightly different error profiles. Quality filtering is essential to minimize downstream analysis artifacts. Supporting previous recommendations, the strand-specificity provides a criterion to distinguish sequencing errors from low abundance polymorphisms.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The pattern of genetic variation within and among populations of a species is strongly affected by its phylogeographic history. Analyses based on putatively neutral markers provide data from which past events, such as population expansions and colonizations, can be inferred. Drosophila virilis is a cosmopolitan species belonging to the virilis group, where divergence times between different phylads go back to the early Miocene. We analysed mitochondrial DNA sequence variation among 35 Drosophila virilis strains covering the species' range in order to detect demographic events that could be used to understand the present characteristics of the species, as well as its differences from other members of the group. RESULTS: Drosophila virilis showed very low nucleotide diversity with haplotypes distributed in a star-like network, consistent with a recent world-wide exponential expansion possibly associated either with domestication or post-glacial colonization. All analyses point towards a rapid population expansion. Coalescence models support this interpretation. The central haplotype in the network, which could be interpreted as ancestral, is widely distributed and gives no information about the geographical origin of the population expansion. The species showed no geographic structure in the distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes, in contrast to results of a recent microsatellite-based analysis. CONCLUSION: The lack of geographic structure and the star-like topology depicted by the D. virilis haplotypes indicate a pattern of global demographic expansion, probably related to human movements, although this interpretation cannot be distinguished from a selective sweep in the mitochondrial DNA until nuclear sequence data become available. The particular behavioural traits of this species, including weak species-discrimination and intraspecific mate choice exercised by the females, can be understood from this perspective.},

  Abstract                 = {The Drosophila virilis species group offers valuable opportunities for studying the roles of chromosomal re-arrangements and mating signals in speciation. The 13 species are divided into two subgroups, the montana and virilis 'phylads'. There is greater differentiation among species within the montana phylad in both karyotype and acoustic signals than exists among members of the virilis phylad. Drosophila montana is a divergent species which is included in the montana phylad. Here, we analyse the phylogeography of D. montana to provide a framework for understanding divergence of acoustic signals among populations. We analysed mitochondrial sequences corresponding to the cytochrome oxidase I and cytochrome oxidase II genes, as well as 16 microsatellite loci, from 108 lines of D. montana covering most of the species' range. The species shows a clear genetic differentiation between North American and Scandinavian populations. Microsatellite allele frequencies and mitochondrial DNA haplotypes gave significant FST values between populations from Canada, USA and Finland. A Bayesian analysis of population structure based on the microsatellite frequencies showed four genetically distinct groups, corresponding to these three populations plus a small sample from Japan. A network based on mitochondrial haplotypes showed two Finnish clades of very different shape and variability, and another clade with all sequences from North America and Japan. All D. montana populations showed evidence of demographic expansion but the patterns inferred by coalescent analysis differed between populations. The divergence times between Scandinavian and North American clades were estimated to range from 450,000 to 900,000 years with populations in Canada and the USA possibly representing descendants of different refugial populations. Long-term separation of D. montana populations could have provided the opportunity for differentiation observed in male signal traits, especially carrier frequency of the song, but relaxation of sexual selection during population expansion may have been necessary.},

We discuss statistical and biological issues that may arise in applications of Lande and Arnold's (1983) multiple-regression approach to measuring selection. We review assumptions involved in estimation and hypothesis testing in regression problems, and we note difficulties that frequently arise as a result of violation of these assumptions. In particular, multicollinearity (extreme intercorrelation of characters) and extrinsic, unmeasured factors affecting fitness may seriously complicate inference regarding selection. Further, violation of the assumption that residuals are normally distributed vitiates tests of significance. For this situation, we suggest applications of recently developed jackknife tests of significance. While fitness regression permits direct assessment of selection in a form suitable for predicting selection response, we suggest that the aim of inferring causal relationships about the effects of phenotypic characters on fitness is greatly facilitated by manipulative experiments. Finally, we discuss alternative definitions of stabilizing and disruptive selection.},

Tentative generalizations about evolutionary processes across species are beginning to emerge, as well as contrasting patterns that characterize different groups of organisms.

The time and area hypothesis holds that tropical climates are older and historically larger, allowing more opportunity for diversification. This hypothesis is supported by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than, and nested within, tropical taxa, and that diversity is positively correlated with the age and area of geographical regions. The diversification rate hypothesis holds that tropical regions diversify faster due to higher rates of speciation (caused by increased opportunities for the evolution of reproductive isolation, or faster molecular evolution, or the increased importance of biotic interactions), or due to lower extinction rates. There is phylogenetic evidence for higher rates of diversification in tropical clades, and palaeontological data demonstrate higher rates of origination for tropical taxa, but mixed evidence for latitudinal differences in extinction rates. Studies of latitudinal variation in incipient speciation also suggest faster speciation in the tropics. Distinguishing the roles of history, speciation and extinction in the origin of the latitudinal gradient represents a major challenge to future research.},

We made a whole genome survey of two-way interacting loci acting within the gametophyte or zygote using independence tests of marker segregations in an F(2) population from an intersubspecific cross between O. sativa subspecies indica and japonica. We detected only one reproducible interaction, and identified paralogous hybrid incompatibility genes, DOPPELGANGER1 (DPL1) and DOPPELGANGER2 (DPL2), by positional cloning. Independent disruptions of DPL1 and DPL2 occurred in indica and japonica, respectively. DPLs encode highly conserved, plant-specific small proteins (∼10 kDa) and are highly expressed in mature anther. Pollen carrying two defective DPL alleles became nonfunctional and did not germinate, suggesting an essential role for DPLs in pollen germination. Although rice has many duplicated genes resulting from ancient whole genome duplication, the origin of this gene duplication was in recent small-scale gene duplication, occurring after Oryza-Brachypodium differentiation. Comparative analyses suggested the geographic and phylogenetic distribution of these two defective alleles, showing that loss-of-function mutations of DPL1 genes emerged multiple times in indica and its wild ancestor, O. rufipogon, and that the DPL2 gene defect is specific to japonica cultivars.},

  Abstract                 = {The widely-accepted Biological Species Concept defines species as populations
that are reproductively isolated, i.e. are unable to mate with one another or produce viable
and fertile progeny when given the opportunity. Speciation is characterized by the
evolution of prezygotic (ethological barriers to interspecific mating) and postzygotic
(reduced viability and fertility of interspecific hybrids) reproductive isolating
mechanisms. Although recent progress has been made towards understanding the
genetic basis of postzygotic isolation, little is known of the genetic architecture of sexual
isolation ? arguably the most important form of reproductive isolation in animals. In
addition, it has not been determined if reproductive isolation occurs due to selection
acting on variation within a species or arises from novel mutations. In order to
understand how new species arise, the genetic basis of variation in mating behavior
within a species, as well as the genetic basis for prezygotic reproductive isolation
between species, must be known.The mating behavior of Drosophila consists of a series of actions that exchange
auditory, visual and chemosensory signals between males and females. Although mating
behavior has been studied extensively in Drosophila, most known genes affecting mating
behavior have been located through the mutation of single genes. The wide range of
variation in courtship behavior in natural populations is believed to arise from the joint
segregation of multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) with varying effects that can be
influenced by the environment. Here, we identified QTL that affect courtship
occurrence, courtship latency, copulation occurrence and copulation latency that segregate between a D. melanogaster strain selected for reduced male mating propensity
(2b) and a standard wild-type strain (Oregon-R). Mating behavior was assessed in a
population of 98 recombinant inbred lines derived from these two strains and QTL
affecting mating behavior were mapped using composite interval mapping. There were
four QTL affecting male mating behavior at cytological locations 1A;3E, 57C;57F,
72A;85F and 96F;99A. We used deficiency complementation mapping to map the
autosomal QTL with much higher resolution to five QTL at 56F5;56F8, 56F9;57A2,
70E1;71F4, 78C5;79A1, and 96F1;97B1. Quantitative complementation tests performed
for 45 positional candidate genes within these intervals revealed seven genes which failed to complement the QTL: eagle, 18 wheeler, Enhancer of split, Polycomb, spermatocyte
arrest, l(2)05510 and l(2)k02206. None of these genes have been previously implicated
in mating behavior, demonstrating that quantitative analysis of subtle variants can reveal
novel pleiotropic effects of key developmental loci on behavior.
In a separate experiment, we mapped QTL contributing to pre-zygotic
reproductive isolation between Drosophila simulans and D. mauritiana. We mapped at
least seven QTL affecting discrimination of D. mauritiana females against D. simulans
males, three QTL affecting D. simulans male traits against which D. mauritiana females
discriminate, and six QTL affecting D. mauritiana male traits against which D. simulans
females discriminate. QTL affecting sexual isolation are largely different in males and
females and between the two species, and are not preferentially located on the X
chromosome. Relatively few QTL with moderate to large effects associated with prezygotic
isolation facilitates future positional cloning of the underlying genes. In contrast to results for postzygotic isolation, no epistasis was detected between QTL for prezygotic
isolation.
Several of the intraspecific D. melanogaster mating behavior QTL overlap those
found to affect reproductive isolation between D. simulans and D. mauritiana. Future
testing of these positional candidate genes for their effect on reproductive isolation could
provide evidence that speciation arises in response to selection acting on naturallyoccurring
variation in a population.},

  Abstract                 = {A major unresolved challenge of evolutionary biology is to determine the nature of the allelic variants of "speciation genes": those alleles whose interaction produces inviable or infertile interspecific hybrids but does not reduce fitness in pure species. Here we map quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting fertility of male hybrids between D. yakuba and its recently discovered sibling species, D. santomea. We mapped three to four X chromosome QTL and two autosomal QTL with large effects on the reduced fertility of D. yakuba and D. santomea backcross males. We observed epistasis between the X-linked QTL and also between the X and autosomal QTL. The X chromosome had a disproportionately large effect on hybrid sterility in both reciprocal backcross hybrids. However, the genetics of hybrid sterility differ between D. yakuba and D. santomea backcross males, both in terms of the magnitude of main effects and in the epistatic interactions. The QTL affecting hybrid fertility did not colocalize with QTL affecting sexual isolation in this species pair, but did colocalize with QTL affecting the marked difference in pigmentation between D. yakuba and D. santomea. These results provide the basis for future high-resolution mapping and ultimately, molecular cloning, of the interacting genes that contribute to hybrid sterility.},

While progress has been made toward understanding the genetic basis of the postzygotic isolating mechanisms of hybrid sterility and inviability, little is known about the genetic basis of prezygotic sexual isolation. Here, we map quantitative trait loci (QTL) contributing to prezygotic reproductive isolation between the sibling species Drosophila santomea and D. yakuba. We mapped at least three QTL affecting discrimination of D. santomea females against D. yakuba males: one X-linked and one autosomal QTL affected the likelihood of copulation, and a second X chromosome QTL affected copulation latency. Three autosomal QTL also affected mating success of D. yakuba males with D. santomea. No epistasis was detected between QTL affecting sexual isolation. The QTL do not overlap between males and females and are not disproportionately concentrated on the X chromosome. There was some overlap in map locations of QTL affecting sexual isolation between D. santomea and D. yakuba with QTL affecting sexual isolation between D. simulans and D. mauritiana and with QTL affecting differences in pigmentation between D. santomea and D. yakuba. Future high-resolution mapping and, ultimately, positional cloning, will reveal whether these traits do indeed have a common genetic basis.},

  Abstract                 = {Species often produce sterile hybrids early in their evolutionary divergence, and some evidence suggests that hybrid sterility may be associated with deviations or disruptions in gene expression. In support of this idea, many studies have shown that a high proportion of male-biased genes are underexpressed, compared with non-sex-biased genes, in sterile F1 male hybrids of Drosophila species. In this study, we examined and compared patterns of misexpression in sterile F1 male hybrids of Drosophila simulans and 2 of its sibling species, Drosophila mauritiana and Drosophila sechellia, at both the larval and adult life stages. We analyzed hybrids using both commercial Drosophila melanogaster microarrays and arrays we developed from reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions of spermatogenesis and reproduction-related transcripts from these species (sperm array). Although the majority of misexpressed transcripts were underexpressed, a disproportionate number of the overexpressed transcripts were located on the X chromosome. We detected a high overlap in the genes misexpressed between the 2 species pairs, and our sperm array was better at detecting such misexpression than the D. melanogaster array, suggesting possible weaknesses in the use of an array designed from another species. We found only minimal misexpression in the larval samples with the sperm array, suggesting that disruptions in spermatogenesis occur after this life stage. Further study of these misexpressed loci may allow us to identify precisely where disruptions in the spermatogenesis pathway occur.},

  Abstract                 = {Obtaining genome-wide genotype data from a set of individuals is the first step in many genomic studies, including genome-wide association and genomic selection. All genotyping methods suffer from some level of missing data, and genotype imputation can be used to fill in the missing data and improve the power of downstream analyses. Model organisms like human and cattle benefit from high-quality reference genomes and panels of reference genotypes that aid in imputation accuracy. In nonmodel organisms, however, genetic and physical maps often are either of poor quality or are completely absent, and there are no panels of reference genotypes available. There is therefore a need for imputation methods designed specifically for nonmodel organisms in which genomic resources are poorly developed and marker order is unreliable or unknown. Here we introduce LinkImpute, a software package based on a k-nearest neighbor genotype imputation method, LD-kNNi, which is designed for unordered markers. No physical or genetic maps are required, and it is designed to work on unphased genotype data from heterozygous species. It exploits the fact that markers useful for imputation often are not physically close to the missing genotype but rather distributed throughout the genome. Using genotyping-by-sequencing data from diverse and heterozygous accessions of apples, grapes, and maize, we compare LD-kNNi with several genotype imputation methods and show that LD-kNNi is fast, comparable in accuracy to the best-existing methods, and exhibits the least bias in allele frequency estimates.},

The termini of eight of the nine genic insertions that we analyzed shared the structural hallmarks of helitron rolling-circle transposons. DNA segments defined by helitron termini contained multiple gene-derived fragments and had a structure typical of nonautonomous helitron-like transposons. Closely related insertions were found in multiple genomic locations. Some of these produced transcripts containing segments of different genes, supporting the idea that these transposition events have a role in exon shuffling and the evolution of new proteins. We identified putative autonomous helitron elements and found evidence for their transcription. Helitrons in maize seem to continually produce new nonautonomous elements responsible for the duplicative insertion of gene segments into new locations and for the unprecedented genic diversity. The maize genome is in constant flux, as transposable elements continue to change both the genic and nongenic fractions of the genome, profoundly affecting genetic diversity.},

In this paper, we present a new implementation of the DUST module that uses the same function to assign a complexity score to a sequence, but uses a different rule by which high-scoring sequences are masked. The new rule masks every nucleotide masked by the old rule and occasionally masks more. The new masking rule corrects two related deficiencies with the old rule. First, the new rule is symmetric with respect to reversing the sequence. Second, the new rule is not context sensitive; the decision to mask a subsequence does not depend on what sequences flank it. The new implementation is at least four times faster than the old on the human genome. We show that both the percentage of additional bases masked and the effect on MegaBLAST outputs are very small.},

  Abstract                 = {Matches to repetitive sequences are usually undesirable in the output of DNA database searches. Repetitive sequences need not be matched to a query, if they can be masked in the database. RepeatMasker/Maskeraid (RM), currently the most widely used software for DNA sequence masking, is slow and requires a library of repetitive template sequences, such as a manually curated RepBase library, that may not exist for newly sequenced genomes.We have developed a software tool called WindowMasker (WM) that identifies and masks highly repetitive DNA sequences in a genome, using only the sequence of the genome itself. WM is orders of magnitude faster than RM because WM uses a few linear-time scans of the genome sequence, rather than local alignment methods that compare each library sequence with each piece of the genome. We validate WM by comparing BLAST outputs from large sets of queries applied to two versions of the same genome, one masked by WM, and the other masked by RM. Even for genomes such as the human genome, where a good RepBase library is available, searching the database as masked with WM yields more matches that are apparently non-repetitive and fewer matches to repetitive sequences. We show that these results hold for transcribed regions as well. WM also performs well on genomes for which much of the sequence was in draft form at the time of the analysis.WM is included in the NCBI C++ toolkit. The source code for the entire toolkit is available at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/toolbox/ncbi_tools++/CURRENT/. Once the toolkit source is unpacked, the instructions for building WindowMasker application in the UNIX environment can be found in file src/app/winmasker/README.build.Supplementary data are available at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/agarwala/windowmasker/windowmasker_suppl.pdf},

Here, we have shown that the correlations (iii, a and b) for 'localized genes' and genes from the bank are in full agreement, indicating that the former set is representative of the latter. We have then used the data (i) and the correlation (ii) to estimate the distribution of genes in isochore families. We have found that 34\% of the genes are located in the GC-poor isochores (which represent 62\% of the genome), 38\% in the GC-rich isochores (31\% of the genome) and 28\% in the GC-richest isochores (3\% of the genome). There is, therefore, a compositional gradient of gene concentration in the human genome. The gene density in the GC-richest 3\% of the genome is about eight times higher than in the GC-rich 31\%, and about 16 times higher than in the GC-poorest 62\%.},

  Abstract                 = {DNA barcoding is a diagnostic method of species identification based on sequencing a short mitochondrial DNA fragment of cytochrome oxidase I (COI), but its ability to correctly diagnose species is limited by the presence of nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (numts). Numts can be coamplified with the mitochondrial orthologue when using universal primers, which can lead to incorrect species identification and an overestimation of the number of species. Some researchers have proposed that using more specific primers may help eliminate numt coamplification, but the efficacy of this method has not been thoroughly tested. In this study, we investigate the taxonomic distribution of numts in 11 lineages within the insect order Orthoptera, by analysing cloned COI sequences and further test the effects of primer specificity on eliminating numt coamplification in four lineages. We find that numts are coamplified in all 11 taxa using universal (barcoding) primers, which suggests that numts may be widespread in other taxonomic groups as well. Increased primer specificity is only effective at reducing numt coamplification in some species tested, and only eliminates it in one species tested. Furthermore, we find that a number of numts do not have stop codons or indels, making it difficult to distinguish them from mitochondrial orthologues, thus putting the efficacy of barcoding quality control measures under question. Our findings suggest that numt coamplification is a serious problem for DNA barcoding and more quality control measures should be implemented to identify and eliminate numts prior to using mitochondrial barcodes for species diagnoses.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of diversity in the marine ecosystem is poorly understood, given the relatively high potential for connectivity, especially for highly mobile species such as whales and dolphins. The killer whale (Orcinus orca) has a worldwide distribution, and individual social groups travel over a wide geographic range. Even so, regional populations have been shown to be genetically differentiated, including among different foraging specialists (ecotypes) in sympatry. Given the strong matrifocal social structure of this species together with strong resource specializations, understanding the process of differentiation will require an understanding of the relative importance of both genetic drift and local adaptation. Here we provide a high-resolution analysis based on nuclear single-nucleotide polymorphic markers and inference about differentiation at both neutral loci and those potentially under selection. We find that all population comparisons, within or among foraging ecotypes, show significant differentiation, including populations in parapatry and sympatry. Loci putatively under selection show a different pattern of structure compared to neutral loci and are associated with gene ontology terms reflecting physiologically relevant functions (e.g. related to digestion). The pattern of differentiation for one ecotype in the North Pacific suggests local adaptation and shows some fixed differences among sympatric ecotypes. We suggest that differential habitat use and resource specializations have promoted sufficient isolation to allow differential evolution at neutral and functional loci, but that the process is recent and dependent on both selection and drift.},

  Abstract                 = {The two "rules of speciation"-the Large X-effect and Haldane's rule-hold throughout the animal kingdom, but the underlying genetic mechanisms that cause them are still unclear. Two predominant explanations-the "dominance theory" and faster male evolution-both have some empirical support, suggesting that the genetic basis of these rules is likely multifarious. We revisit one historical explanation for these rules, based on dysfunctional genetic interactions involving genes recently moved between chromosomes. We suggest that gene movement specifically off or onto the X chromosome is another mechanism that could contribute to the two rules, especially as X chromosome movements can be subject to unique sex-specific and sex chromosome specific consequences in hybrids. Our hypothesis is supported by patterns emerging from comparative genomic data, including a strong bias in interchromosomal gene movements involving the X and an overrepresentation of male reproductive functions among chromosomally relocated genes. In addition, our model indicates that the contribution of gene movement to the two rules in any specific group will depend upon key developmental and reproductive parameters that are taxon specific. We provide several testable predictions that can be used to assess the importance of gene movement as a contributor to these rules in the future. },

The number of INDELs in human genomes is second only to the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and, in terms of base pairs of variation, INDELs cause similar levels of variation as SNPs. Many of these INDELs map to functionally important sites within human genes, and thus, are likely to influence human traits and diseases. Therefore, small INDEL variation will play a prominent role in personalized medicine.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the origin and maintenance of barriers to gene exchange is a central goal of speciation research. Hawaiian swordtail crickets (genus Laupala) represent one of the most rapidly speciating animal groups yet identified. Extensive acoustic diversity, strong premating isolation, and female preference for conspecific acoustic signals in laboratory phonotaxis trials have strongly supported divergence in mate recognition as the driving force behind the explosive speciation seen in this system. However, recent work has shown that female preference for conspecific male calling song does not extend to mate choice at close range among these crickets, leading to the hypothesis that additional sexual signals are involved in mate recognition and premating isolation. Here we examine patterns of variation in cuticular lipids among several species of Laupala from Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii. Results demonstrate (1) a rapid and dramatic evolution of cuticular lipid composition among species in this genus, (2) significant differences among males and females in cuticular lipid composition, and (3) a significant reduction in the complexity of cuticular lipid profiles in species from the Big Island of Hawaii as compared to two outgroup species from Maui. These results suggest that behavioral barriers to gene exchange in Laupala may be composed of multiple mate recognition signals, a pattern common in other cricket species.},

  Abstract                 = {A previous investigation of cuticular hydrocarbon variation among Hawaiian swordtail crickets (genus Laupala) revealed that these species differ dramatically in composition of cuticular lipids. Cuticular lipid extracts of Laupala species sampled from the Big Island of Hawaii also possess a greatly reduced number of chemicals (as evidenced by number of gas chromatography peaks) relative to ancestral taxa sampled from the geologically older island of Maui. One possible explanation for this biogeographic pattern is that reduction in chemical diversity observed among the Big Island taxa represents the loss of ancestral hydrocarbons found on Maui. To test this hypothesis, we characterized and identified the structures of cuticular hydrocarbons for seven species of Hawaiian Laupala, two from Maui (ancestral) and five from the Big Island of Hawaii (derived) by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Big Island Laupala possessed a reduced number of alkenes as well as a reduction in the diversity of methyl-branch positions relative to species sampled from Maui (ancestral), thus supporting our hypothesis of a founder-induced loss of chemical diversity. The reduction in diversity of ancestral hydrocarbons was more severe within one of the two sister lineages on the Big Island, suggesting that post-colonizing processes, such as drift or selection, also have influenced hydrocarbon evolution in this group.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary Bright-red colors in vertebrates are commonly involved in sexual, social, and interspecific signaling [1‚Äì8] and are largely produced by ketocarotenoid pigments. In land birds, ketocarotenoids such as astaxanthin are usually metabolically derived via ketolation of dietary yellow carotenoids [9, 10]. However, the molecular basis of this gene-environment mechanism has remained obscure. Here we use the yellowbeak mutation in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) to investigate the genetic basis of red coloration. Wild-type ketocarotenoids were absent in the beak and tarsus of yellowbeak birds. The yellowbeak mutation mapped to chromosome 8, close to a cluster of cytochrome \{P450\} loci (CYP2J2-like) that are candidates for carotenoid ketolases. The wild-type zebra finch genome was found to have three intact genes in this¬†cluster: CYP2J19A, CYP2J19B, and CYP2J40. In yellowbeak, there are multiple mutations: loss of a¬†complete \{CYP2J19\} gene, a modified remaining \{CYP2J19\} gene (CYP2J19yb), and a non-synonymous \{SNP\} in CYP2J40. In wild-type birds, \{CYP2J19\} loci are expressed in ketocarotenoid-containing tissues: \{CYP2J19A\} only in the retina and \{CYP2J19B\} in the beak and tarsus and to a variable extent in the retina. In contrast, expression of \{CYP2J19yb\} is barely detectable in the beak of yellowbeak birds. \{CYP2J40\} has broad tissue expression and shows no differences between wild-type and yellowbeak. Our results indicate that \{CYP2J19\} genes are strong candidates for the carotenoid ketolase and imply that ketolation occurs in the integument in zebra finches. Since cytochrome \{P450\} enzymes include key detoxification enzymes, our results raise the intriguing possibility that red coloration may be an honest signal of detoxification ability. },

  Abstract                 = {The degree of population structure within species often varies considerably among loci. This makes it difficult to determine whether observed variance reflects neutral-drift stochasticity or locus-specific selection at one or more loci. This uncertainty is exacerbated when evolutionary equilibrium cannot be assumed and/or admixture potentially inflates genomic variance. Thus, the value of a 'genome scan', where locus-specific summary statistics are compared with a simulated neutral distribution among loci, may be limited in secondary contact zones if the null distribution is sensitive to the timing of secondary contact. Of particular interest here is the wide variance previously observed in locus-specific patterns of population structure between Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico populations of eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. To test the robustness of an equilibrium null model, we compared among-locus distributions of F(ST) simulated under migration-drift equilibrium and several nonequilibrium secondary contact histories. We then tested for evidence of divergent selection between two oyster populations on either side of a secondary contact zone using 215 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci. Constant-migration equilibrium and nonequilibrium secondary-contact simulations produced equivalent distributions of F(ST) when anchored by the global mean F(ST) observed in oysters, 0.0917. The 99th quantile of simulated neutral F(ST) encompassed most of the variation among oyster loci. Three AFLP loci exhibited F(ST) values higher than this threshold. Although no locus was significant after correcting for multiple tests, our results show in geographically clinal organisms: AFLPs can efficiently characterize the genomic distribution of F(ST); equilibrium models can be used to evaluate outliers; these procedures help focus research on genomic regions of interest.},

  Abstract                 = {The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution has been widely accepted as the guiding principle for understanding how selection affects gene sequence evolution. One of its central predictions is that the rate at which proteins evolve should negatively scale with effective population size (Ne). In contrast to the expectation of reduced selective constraint in the mitochondrial genome following from its lower Ne, we observe what can be interpreted as the opposite: for a taxonomically diverse set of organisms (birds, mammals, insects, and nematodes), mitochondrially encoded protein-coding genes from the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (mtOXPHOS; n = 12–13) show markedly stronger signatures of purifying selection (illustrated by low dN/dS) than their nuclear counterparts interacting in the same pathway (nuOXPHOS; n: ∼75). To understand these unexpected evolutionary dynamics, we consider a number of structural and functional parameters including gene expression, hydrophobicity, transmembrane position, gene ontology, GC content, substitution rate, proportion of amino acids in transmembrane helices, and protein–protein interaction. Across all taxa, unexpectedly large differences in gene expression levels (RNA-seq) between nuclear and mitochondrially encoded genes, and to a lower extent hydrophobicity, explained most of the variation in dN/dS. Similarly, differences in dN/dS between functional OXPHOS protein complexes could largely be explained by gene expression differences. Overall, by including gene expression and other functional parameters, the unexpected mitochondrial evolutionary dynamics can be understood. Our results not only reaffirm the link between gene expression and protein evolution but also open new questions about the functional role of expression level variation between mitochondrial genes.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently diverged taxa may continue to exchange genes. A number of models of speciation with gene flow propose that the frequency of gene exchange will be lower in genomic regions of low recombination and that these regions will therefore be more differentiated. However, several population-genetic models that focus on selection at linked sites also predict greater differentiation in regions of low recombination simply as a result of faster sorting of ancestral alleles even in the absence of gene flow. Moreover, identifying the actual amount of gene flow from patterns of genetic variation is tricky, because both ancestral polymorphism and migration lead to shared variation between recently diverged taxa. New analytic methods have been developed to help distinguish ancestral polymorphism from migration. Along with a growing number of datasets of multi-locus DNA sequence variation, these methods have spawned a renewed interest in speciation models with gene flow. Here, we review both speciation and population-genetic models that make explicit predictions about how the rate of recombination influences patterns of genetic variation within and between species. We then compare those predictions with empirical data of DNA sequence variation in rabbits and mice. We find strong support for the prediction that genomic regions experiencing low levels of recombination are more differentiated. In most cases, reduced gene flow appears to contribute to the pattern, although disentangling the relative contribution of reduced gene flow and selection at linked sites remains a challenge. We suggest fruitful areas of research that might help distinguish between different models.},

  Abstract                 = {The Heliconius butterflies are a diverse recent radiation comprising multiple levels of divergence with ongoing gene flow between species. The recently sequenced genome of Heliconius melpomene allowed us to investigate the genomic evolution of this group using dense RAD marker sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of 54 individuals robustly supported reciprocal monophyly of H. melpomene and Heliconius cydno and refuted previous phylogenetic hypotheses that H. melpomene may be paraphylectic with respect to H. cydno. Heliconius timareta also formed a monophyletic clade closely related but distinct from H. cydno with Heliconius heurippa falling within this clade. We find evidence for genetic admixture between sympatric populations of the sister clades H. melpomene and H. cydno/timareta, particularly between H. cydno and H. melpomene from Central America and between H. timareta and H. melpomene from the eastern slopes of the Andes. Between races, divergence is primarily explained by isolation by distance and there is no detectable genetic population structure between parapatric races, suggesting that hybrid zones between races are not zones of secondary contact. Our results also support previous findings that colour pattern loci are shared between populations and species with similar colour pattern elements. Furthermore, this pattern is almost unique to these genomic regions, with only a very small number of other loci showing significant similarity between populations and species with similar colour patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner's instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology and their focal role in Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have rekindled a growing interest in the whole-genome sequence assembly (WGSA) problem, thereby, inundating the field with a plethora of new formalizations, algorithms, heuristics and implementations. And yet, scant attention has been paid to comparative assessments of these assemblers' quality and accuracy. No commonly accepted and standardized method for comparison exists yet. Even worse, widely used metrics to compare the assembled sequences emphasize only size, poorly capturing the contig quality and accuracy. This paper addresses these concerns: it highlights common anomalies in assembly accuracy through a rigorous study of several assemblers, compared under both standard metrics (N50, coverage, contig sizes, etc.) as well as a more comprehensive metric (Feature-Response Curves, FRC) that is introduced here; FRC transparently captures the trade-offs between contigs' quality against their sizes. For this purpose, most of the publicly available major sequence assemblers--both for low-coverage long (Sanger) and high-coverage short (Illumina) reads technologies--are compared. These assemblers are applied to microbial (Escherichia coli, Brucella, Wolbachia, Staphylococcus, Helicobacter) and partial human genome sequences (Chr. Y), using sequence reads of various read-lengths, coverages, accuracies, and with and without mate-pairs. It is hoped that, based on these evaluations, computational biologists will identify innovative sequence assembly paradigms, bioinformaticists will determine promising approaches for developing "next-generation" assemblers, and biotechnologists will formulate more meaningful design desiderata for sequencing technology platforms. A new software tool for computing the FRC metric has been developed and is available through the AMOS open-source consortium.},

We model the effects of the genetic barrier to gene flow caused by a chromosomal rearrangement on the rate of accumulation of postzygotic isolation genes in parapatry. We find that, if reproductive isolation is produced by the accumulation in parapatry of sets of alleles compatible within but incompatible across species, chromosomal rearrangements are far more likely to favor it than classical genetic barriers without chromosomal changes. New evidence of the role of chromosomal rearrangements in parapatric speciation suggests that postzygotic isolation is often due to the accumulation of such incompatibilities. The model makes testable qualitative predictions about the genetic signature of speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {The breeding system of parasitic protozoa affects the evolution of drug resistance and virulence, and is relevant to disease diagnosis and the development of chemo- and immunotherapy. A major group of protozoan parasites, the phylum Apicomplexa, that includes the aetiological agents of malaria, toxoplasmosis and coccidiosis, all have dimorphic sexual stages. The sex ratio (proportion of males produced by parasites) is predicted to depend upon the inbreeding rate, and it has been suggested that sex-ratio data offer a relatively cheap and easy method for indirectly estimating inbreeding rates. Here, we exploit a new theoretical machinery to show that there are generally valid relationships between f, Wright's coefficient of inbreeding, and sex ratio, z(*), the generality being with respect to population structure. To focus the discussion, we concentrate on malaria and show that the previously derived result, f = 1 - 2z(*), does not depend on the artificial assumptions about population structure that were previously made. Not only does this justify the use of sex ratio as an indirect measure of f, but also we argue that it may actually be preferable to measure f by measuring sex ratios, rather than by measuring departures from Hardy-Weinberg genotypic proportions both in malaria and parasites more generally.},

Such differences may function as chemical signals, being detected via contact chemoreception and used during mate choice as in other insects. Gas chromatography shows that the subspecies have diverged in the composition of their cuticular hydrocarbons. This difference between subspecies exists over and above variation in cuticular hydrocarbons among individual populations. The majority of the difference can be attributed to the relative amounts of a small group of compounds present in the cuticle.

Partial assortative mating between subspecies must result from differences in elements of the sequence of behaviors that leads to mating. It was already known that the subspecies differ in the structure of the acoustic mating signal produced by males and in the amount of song produced under laboratory conditions. Here we investigate whether any differences exist in male mating strategies in the field, concentrating on the prediction that male C. p. erythropus sing less and compensate for this by active searching (males divide their time between singing and moving in search of females). Results of field observations show that the two subspecies do in fact allocate their time differently. C. p. erythropus males spend almost twice as much time moving around the habitat as C. p. parallelus males Furthermore, C. p. parallelus males divide their time into long bouts of continuous singing alternating with periods of movement. C. p. erythropus males, on the other hand, sing in short bursts interspersed with movement. The possible reasons for this divergence in male mating behavior and its consequences are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {Mathematical models are presented for the evolution of postmating and premating reproductive isolation. In the case of postmating isolation it is assumed that hybrid sterility or inviability is caused by incompatibility of alleles at one or two loci, and evolution of reproductive isolation occurs by random fixation of different incompatibility alleles in different populations. Mutations are assumed to occur following either the stepwise mutation model or the infinite-allele model. Computer simulations by using ItÃ´'s stochastic differential equations have shown that in the model used the reproductive isolation mechanism evolves faster in small populations than in large populations when the mutation rate remains the same. In populations of a given size it evolves faster when the number of loci involved is large than when this is small. In general, however, evolution of isolation mechanisms is a very slow process, and it would take thousands to millions of generations if the mutation rate is of the order of 10-5 per generation. Since gene substitution occurs as a stochastic process, the time required for the establishment of reproductive isolation has a large variance. Although the average time of evolution of isolation mechanisms is very long, substitution of incompatibility genes in a population occurs rather quickly once it starts. The intrapopulational fertility or viability is always very high. In the model of premating isolation it is assumed that mating preference or compatibility is determined by male- and female-limited characters, each of which is controlled by a single locus with multiple alleles, and mating occurs only when the male and female characters are compatible with each other. Computer simulations have shown that the dynamics of evolution of premating isolation mechanism is very similar to that of postmating isolation mechanism, and the mean and variance of the time required for establishment of premating isolation are very large. Theoretical predictions obtained from the present study about the speed of evolution of reproductive isolation are consistent with empirical data available from vertebrate organisms. },

  Abstract                 = {One of the most important problems in evolutionary biology is to understand how new species are generated in nature. In the past, it was difficult to study this problem because our lifetime is too short to observe the entire process of speciation. In recent years, however, molecular and genomic techniques have been developed for identifying and studying the genes involved in speciation. Using these techniques, many investigators have already obtained new findings. At present, however, the results obtained are complex and quite confusing. We have therefore attempted to understand these findings coherently with a historical perspective and clarify the roles of mutation and natural selection in speciation. We have first indicated that the root of the currently burgeoning field of plant genomics goes back to Hugo de Vries, who proposed the mutation theory of evolution more than a century ago and that he unknowingly found the importance of polyploidy and chromosomal rearrangements in plant speciation. We have then shown that the currently popular DobzhanskyâMuller model of evolution of reproductive isolation is only one of many possible mechanisms. Some of them are Okaâs model of duplicate gene mutations, multiallelic speciation, mutation-rescue model, segregation-distorter gene model, heterochromatin-associated speciation, single-locus model, etc. The occurrence of speciation also depends on the reproductive system, population size, bottleneck effects, and environmental factors, such as temperature and day length. Some authors emphasized the importance of natural selection to speed up speciation, but mutation is crucial in speciation because reproductive barriers cannot be generated without mutations.},

  Abstract                 = {The accuracies and efficiencies of three different methods of making phylogenetic trees from gene frequency data were examined by using computer simulation. The methods examined are UPGMA, Farris' (1972) method, and Tateno et al.'s (1982) modified Farris method. In the computer simulation eight species (or populations) were assumed to evolve according to a given model tree, and the evolutionary changes of allele frequencies were followed by using the infinite-allele model. At the end of the simulated evolution five genetic distance measures (Nei's standard and minimum distances, Rogers' distance, Cavalli-Sforza's f theta, and the modified Cavalli-Sforza distance) were computed for all pairs of species, and the distance matrix obtained for each distance measure was used for reconstructing a phylogenetic tree. The phylogenetic tree obtained was then compared with the model tree. The results obtained indicate that in all tree-making methods examined the accuracies of both the topology and branch lengths of a reconstructed tree (rooted tree) are very low when the number of loci used is less than 20 but gradually increase with increasing number of loci. When the expected number of gene substitutions (M) for the shortest branch is 0.1 or more per locus and 30 or more loci are used, the topological error as measured by the distortion index (dT) is not great, but the probability of obtaining the correct topology (P) is less than 0.5 even with 60 loci. When M is as small as 0.004, P is substantially lower. In obtaining a good topology (small dT and high P) UPGMA and the modified Farris method generally show a better performance than the Farris method. The poor performance of the Farris method is observed even when Rogers' distance which obeys the triangle inequality is used. The main reason for this seems to be that the Farris method often gives overestimates of branch lengths. For estimating the expected branch lengths of the true tree UPGMA shows the best performance. For this purpose Nei's standard distance gives a better result than the others because of its linear relationship with the number of gene substitutions. Rogers' or Cavalli-Sforza's distance gives a phylogenetic tree in which the parts near the root are condensed and the other parts are elongated. It is recommended that more than 30 loci, including both polymorphic and monomorphic loci, be used for making phylogenetic trees. The conclusions from this study seem to apply also to data on nucleotide differences obtained by the restriction enzyme techniques.},

However, some of the traditional organising principles of the subject area no longer provide a satisfactory framework, such as the classification of speciation mechanisms by geographical context into allopatric, parapatric and sympatry classes. Therefore, we have asked where speciation research should be directed in the coming years. Here, we present a distillation of questions about the mechanisms of speciation, the genetic basis of speciation and the relationship between speciation and diversity. Our list of topics is not exhaustive; rather we aim to promote discussion on research priorities and on the common themes that underlie disparate speciation processes.},

  Abstract                 = {The mesoderm- and muscle-specific expression of microRNAs observed in a wide range of organisms suggests that post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs can contribute significantly to the regulation of muscle development and physiology. One of these microRNAs, miR-1, is among the most widely conserved microRNAs during evolution. Genetic inactivation of miR-1 in Drosophila has shown that miR-1 is essential for maintaining the development and integrity of body wall muscles during phases of rapid growth, whereas it is not needed for normal mesoderm patterning and muscle specification. Expression analysis of a large set of potential miR-1 target mRNAs has revealed that these mRNAs tend to be expressed in non-muscle tissues, in patterns that are mutually exclusive with miR-1. Together, these findings lend support to the hypothesis that miR-1 exerts 'quality control' during muscle development by blocking detrimental mRNAs that are promiscuously expressed. Other miRNAs might promote specific developmental switches during the development and regeneration of muscles.},

It is demonstrated how ascertainment biases, due to biased sampling of loci, can be avoided, at least in some cases, by appropriate conditioning when calculating the likelihood function. Second, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for analyzing linked SNPs is developed. This method can be used for Bayesian and likelihood inference on linked SNPs. The utility of the method is illustrated by estimating recombination rates in a human data set containing 17 SNPs and 60 individuals. Both methods are based on assumptions of low mutation rates.},

Here we fit a detailed model of human demography that incorporates divergence, migration, admixture, and changes in population size to directly sequenced data from 13,400 protein coding genes from 20 European-American and 19 African-American individuals. Based on this demographic model, we use several new and established statistical methods for identifying genes with extreme patterns of polymorphism likely to be caused by Darwinian selection, providing the first genome-wide analysis of allele frequency distributions in humans based on directly sequenced data. The tests are based on observations of excesses of high frequency-derived alleles, excesses of low frequency-derived alleles, and excesses of differences in allele frequencies between populations. We detect numerous new genes with strong evidence of selection, including a number of genes related to psychiatric and other diseases. We also show that microRNA controlled genes evolve under extremely high constraints and are more likely to undergo negative selection than other genes. Furthermore, we show that genes involved in muscle development have been subject to positive selection during recent human history. In accordance with previous studies, we find evidence for negative selection against mutations in genes associated with Mendelian disease and positive selection acting on genes associated with several complex diseases.},

In this method, we first estimate the allele frequency spectrum using maximum likelihood. In contrast to previous methods, the likelihood function is calculated using a dynamic programming algorithm and numerically optimized using analytical derivatives. We then use a bayesian method for estimating the sample allele frequency in a single site, and show how the method can be used for genotype calling and SNP calling. We also show how the method can be extended to various other cases including cases with deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We evaluate the statistical properties of the methods using simulations and by application to a real data set.},

Statistical methods must instead be developed that can explicitly take into account each method of SNP discovery. Here we review some of the current methods for analyzing SNPs and derive sampling distributions for single SNPs and pairs of SNPs for some common SNP discovery schemes. We also show that the ascertainment scheme has a large effect on the estimation of linkage disequilibrium and recombination, and describe some methods of correcting for ascertainment biases when estimating recombination rates from SNP data.},

The two populations are assumed to be descended from a panmictic ancestral population at some time in the past and may (or may not) after that be connected by migration. The use of a Markov chain Monte Carlo method allows the joint estimation of multiple demographic parameters in either a Bayesian or a likelihood framework. The parameters estimated include the migration rate for each population, the time since the two populations diverged from a common ancestral population, and the relative size of each of the two current populations and of the common ancestral population. The results show that even a single nonrecombining genetic locus can provide substantial power to test the hypothesis of no ongoing migration and/or to test models of symmetric migration between the two populations. The use of the method is illustrated in an application to mitochondrial DNA sequence data from a fish species: the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus).},

  Abstract                 = {Theory predicts that reproductive isolation may be due to intrinsic genetic incompatibilities or extrinsic ecological factors. Therefore, an understanding of the genetic basis of isolation may require analyses of evolutionary processes in situ to include environmental factors. Here we study genetic isolation between populations of sculpins (Cottus) at 168 microsatellites. Genomic clines were fit using 480 individuals sampled across independent natural hybrid zones that have formed between one invading species and two separate populations of a resident species. Our analysis tests for deviations from neutral patterns of introgression at individual loci based on expectations given genome-wide admixture. Roughly 51\% of the loci analysed displayed significant deviations. An overall deficit of interspecific heterozygotes in 26\% and 21\% of the loci suggests that widespread underdominance drives genomic isolation. At the same time, selection promotes introgression of almost 30\% of the markers, which implies that hybridization may increase the fitness of admixed individuals. Cases of overdominance or epistatic interactions were relatively rare. Despite the similarity of the two hybrid zones in their overall genomic composition, patterns observed at individual loci show little correlation between zones and many fit different genotypic models of fitness. At this point, it remains difficult to determine whether these results are due to differences in external selection pressures or cryptic genetic differentiation of distinct parental populations. In the future, data from mapped genetic markers and on variation of ecological factors will provide additional insights into the contribution of these factors to variation in the evolutionary consequences of hybridization.},

However, the evolutionary dynamics leading to the emergence of newly adapted gene pools after hybridization are largely unexplored. Here, we argue that the identification and analysis of the dynamic processes that occur after the first contact deserve specific attention, because this is the phase where hybrid speciation is most different from other forms of speciation.},

In particular, we need more ecological work on putative cases of reinforcement, more theoretical models that give diagnostic predictions of reinforcement relative to other modes of divergence, and empirical studies to evaluate these diagnostic predictions.},

We have examined the genetic basis of hybrid sterility and female species preferences in Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila persimilis, two occasionally hybridizing North American species. Contrary to findings in other species groups, very few regions of the genome were associated with these characters, and these regions are associated also with fixed arrangement differences (inversions) between these species. From our results, we propose a preliminary genic model whereby inversions may contribute to the speciation process, thereby explaining the abundance of arrangement differences between closely related species that co-occur geographically. We suggest that inversions create linkage groups that cause sterility to persist between hybridizing taxa. The maintenance of this sterility allows the species to persist in the face of gene flow longer than without such inversions, and natural selection will have a greater opportunity to decrease the frequency of interspecies matings.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past decade, many studies documented high genetic divergence between closely related species in genomic regions experiencing restricted recombination in hybrids, such as within chromosomal rearrangements or areas adjacent to centromeres. Such regions have been called 'islands of speciation' because of their presumed role in maintaining the integrity of species despite gene flow elsewhere in the genome. Here, we review alternative explanations for such patterns. Segregation of ancestral variation or artifacts of nucleotide diversity within species can readily lead to higher F-ST in regions of restricted recombination than other parts of the genome, even in the complete absence of interspecies gene flow, and thereby cause investigators to erroneously conclude that islands of speciation exist. We conclude by discussing strengths and weaknesses of various means for testing the role of restricted recombination in maintaining species. Heredity (2009) 103, 439-444; doi:10.1038/hdy.2009.151},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic differentiation can be highly variable across the genome. For example, loci under divergent selection and those tightly linked to them may exhibit elevated differentiation compared to neutral regions. These represent "outlier loci" whose differentiation exceeds neutral expectations. Adaptive divergence can also increase genome-wide differentiation by promoting general barriers to neutral gene flow, thereby facilitating genomic divergence via genetic drift. This latter process can yield a positive correlation between adaptive phenotypic divergence and neutral genetic differentiation (described here as "isolation-by-adaptation"). Here, we examine both these processes by combining an AFLP genome scan of two host plant ecotypes of Timema cristinae walking-sticks with existing data on adaptive phenotypic divergence and ecological speciation in these insects. We found that about 8\% of loci are outliers in multiple population comparisons. Replicated comparisons between population-pairs using the same versus different host species revealed that 1-2\% of loci are subject to host-related selection specifically. Locus-specific analyses revealed that up to 10\% of putatively neutral (nonoutlier) AFLP loci exhibit significant isolation-by-adaptation. Our results suggest that selection may affect differentiation directly, via linkage, or by facilitating genetic drift. They thus illustrate the varied and sometimes nonintuitive contributions of selection to heterogeneous genomic differentiation.},

Progress has been made in detecting individual 'speciation genes' that cause reproductive isolation. In contrast, until recently, less attention has been given to genome-wide patterns of divergence during speciation. Thus, major questions remain concerning how individual speciation genes are arrayed within the genome, and how this affects speciation. This theme issue is dedicated to exploring this genomic perspective of speciation. Given recent sequencing and computational advances that now allow genomic analyses in most organisms, the goal is to help move the field towards a more integrative approach. This issue draws upon empirical studies in plants and animals, and theoretical work, to review and further document patterns of genomic divergence. In turn, these studies begin to disentangle the role that different processes, such as natural selection, gene flow and recombination rate, play in generating observed patterns. These factors are considered in the context of how genomes diverge as speciation unfolds, from beginning to end. The collective results point to how experimental work is now required, in conjunction with theory and sequencing studies, to move the field from descriptive studies of patterns of divergence towards a predictive framework that tackles the causes and consequences of genome-wide patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic differentiation during adaptive divergence and speciation is heterogeneous among genomic regions. Some regions can be highly differentiated between populations, for example, because they harbour genes under divergent selection or those causing reproductive isolation and thus are resistant to gene flow. Other regions might be homogenized by gene flow and thus weakly differentiated. Debates persist about the number of differentiated regions expected under divergence with gene flow, and their causes, size, and genomic distribution. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, a study of freshwater stickleback used next-generation sequencing to shed novel insight into these issues (Roesti et al. 2012). Many genomic regions distributed across the genome were strongly differentiated, indicating divergence with gene flow can involve a greater number of loci than often thought. Nonetheless, differentiation of some regions, such as those near the centre of chromosomes where recombination is reduced, was strongly accentuated over others. Thus, divergence was widespread yet highly heterogeneous across the genome. Moreover, different population pairs varied in patterns of differentiation, illustrating how genomic divergence builds up across stages of the speciation process. The study demonstrates how variation in different evolutionary processes, such as selection and recombination rate, can combine to result in similar genomic patterns. Future work could focus on teasing apart the contributions of different processes for causing differentiation, a task facilitated by experimental manipulations.},

  Abstract                 = {Two models for speciation via selection have been proposed. In the well-known model of 'ecological speciation', divergent natural selection between environments drives the evolution of reproductive isolation. In a second 'mutation-order' model, different, incompatible mutations (alleles) fix in different populations adapting to the same selective pressure. How to demonstrate mutation-order speciation has been unclear, although it has been argued that it can be ruled out when gene flow occurs because the same, most advantageous allele will fix in all populations. However, quantitative examination of the interaction of factors influencing the likelihood of mutation-order speciation is lacking. We used simulation models to study how gene flow, hybrid incompatibility, selective advantage, timing of origination of new mutations and an initial period of allopatric differentiation affect population divergence via the mutation-order process. We find that at least some population divergence can occur under a reasonably wide range of conditions, even with moderate gene flow. However, strong divergence (e.g. fixation of different alleles in different populations) requires very low gene flow, and is promoted when (i) incompatible mutations have similar fitness advantages, (ii) less fit mutations arise slightly earlier in evolutionary time than more fit alternatives, and (iii) allopatric divergence occurs prior to secondary contact.},

  Abstract                 = {Levels of genetic differentiation between populations can be highly variable across the genome, with divergent selection contributing to such heterogeneous genomic divergence. For example, loci under divergent selection and those tightly physically linked to them may exhibit stronger differentiation than neutral regions with weak or no linkage to such loci. Divergent selection can also increase genome-wide neutral differentiation by reducing gene flow (e.g. by causing ecological speciation), thus promoting divergence via the stochastic effects of genetic drift. These consequences of divergent selection are being reported in recently accumulating studies that identify: (i) 'outlier loci' with higher levels of divergence than expected under neutrality, and (ii) a positive association between the degree of adaptive phenotypic divergence and levels of molecular genetic differentiation across population pairs ['isolation by adaptation' (IBA)]. The latter pattern arises because as adaptive divergence increases, gene flow is reduced (thereby promoting drift) and genetic hitchhiking increased. Here, we review and integrate these previously disconnected concepts and literatures. We find that studies generally report 5-10\% of loci to be outliers. These selected regions were often dispersed across the genome, commonly exhibited replicated divergence across different population pairs, and could sometimes be associated with specific ecological variables. IBA was not infrequently observed, even at neutral loci putatively unlinked to those under divergent selection. Overall, we conclude that divergent selection makes diverse contributions to heterogeneous genomic divergence. Nonetheless, the number, size, and distribution of genomic regions affected by selection varied substantially among studies, leading us to discuss the potential role of divergent selection in the growth of regions of differentiation (i.e. genomic islands of divergence), a topic in need of future investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {Diverse geographical modes and mechanisms of speciation are known, and individual speciation genes have now been identified. Despite this progress, genome-wide outcomes of different evolutionary processes during speciation are less understood. Here, we integrate ecological and spatial information, mating trials, transplantation data and analysis of 86 130 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight populations (28 pairwise comparisons) of Timema cristinae stick insects to test the effects of different factors on genomic divergence in a system undergoing ecological speciation. We find patterns consistent with effects of numerous factors, including geographical distance, gene flow, divergence in host plant use and climate, and selection against maladaptive hybridization (i.e. reinforcement). For example, the number of highly differentiated 'outlier loci', allele-frequency clines and the overall distribution of genomic differentiation were recognizably affected by these factors. Although host use has strong effects on phenotypic divergence and reproductive isolation, its effects on genomic divergence were subtler and other factors had pronounced effects. The results demonstrate how genomic data can provide new insights into speciation and how genomic divergence can be complex, yet predictable. Future work could adopt experimental, mapping and functional approaches to directly test which genetic regions are affected by selection and determine their physical location in the genome.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Genetic divergence during speciation with gene flow is heterogeneous across the genome, with some regions exhibiting stronger differentiation than others. Exceptionally differentiated regions are often assumed to experience reduced introgression, i.e., reduced flow of alleles from one population into another because such regions are affected by divergent selection or cause reproductive isolation. In contrast, the remainder of the genome can be homogenized by high introgression. Although many studies have documented variation across the genome in genetic differentiation, there are few tests of this hypothesis that explicitly quantify introgression. Here, we provide such a test using 38,304 SNPs in populations of Timema cristinae stick insects. We quantify whether loci that are highly divergent between geographically separated ('allopatric') populations exhibit unusual patterns of introgression in admixed populations. To the extent this is true, highly divergent loci between allopatric populations contribute to reproductive isolation in admixed populations. RESULTS: As predicted, we find a substantial association between locus-specific divergence between allopatric populations and locus-specific introgression in admixed populations. However, many loci depart from this relationship, sometimes strongly so. We also report evidence for selection against foreign alleles due to local adaptation. CONCLUSIONS: Loci that are strongly differentiated between allopatric populations sometimes contribute to reproductive isolation in admixed populations. However, geographic variation in selection and local adaptation, in aspects of genetic architecture (such as organization of genes, recombination rate variation, number and effect size of variants contributing to adaptation, etc.), and in stochastic evolutionary processes such as drift can cause strong differentiation of loci that do not always contribute to reproductive isolation. The results have implications for the theory of 'genomic islands of speciation'.},

  Abstract                 = {The long-standing goal of finding genes causing reproductive isolation is being achieved. To better link the genetics with the process of speciation, we propose that 'speciation gene' be defined as any gene contributing to the evolution of reproductive isolation. Characterizing a speciation gene involves establishing that the gene affects a component of reproductive isolation; demonstrating that divergence at the locus occurred before completion of speciation; and quantifying the effect size of the gene (i.e. the increase in total reproductive isolation caused by its divergence). Review of a sample of candidate speciation genes found that few meet these criteria. Improved characterization of speciation genes will clarify how numerous they are, their properties and how they affect genome-wide patterns of divergence.},

They interpreted gradient and wave patterns in these maps as signatures of specific migration events. These interpretations have been controversial, but influential, and the use of PCA has become widespread in analysis of population genetics data. However, the behavior of PCA for genetic data showing continuous spatial variation, such as might exist within human continental groups, has been less well characterized. Here, we find that gradients and waves observed in Cavalli-Sforza et al.'s maps resemble sinusoidal mathematical artifacts that arise generally when PCA is applied to spatial data, implying that the patterns do not necessarily reflect specific migration events. Our findings aid interpretation of PCA results and suggest how PCA can help correct for continuous population structure in association studies.},

Here we show the limitations of this approach. We argue that standard natural selection theory in the context of precise models of population structure represents a simpler and superior approach, allows the evaluation of multiple competing hypotheses, and provides an exact framework for interpreting empirical observations.},

  Abstract                 = {Plasmodium parasites, the causal agents of malaria, result in more than 1 million deaths annually. Plasmodium are unicellular eukaryotes with small ∼23 Mb genomes encoding ∼5200 protein-coding genes. The protein-coding genes comprise about half of these genomes. Although evolutionary processes have a significant impact on malaria control, the selective pressures within Plasmodium genomes are poorly understood, particularly in the non-protein-coding portion of the genome. We use evolutionary methods to describe selective processes in both the coding and non-coding regions of these genomes. Based on genome alignments of seven Plasmodium species, we show that protein-coding, intergenic and intronic regions are all subject to purifying selection and we identify 670 conserved non-genic elements. We then use genome-wide polymorphism data from P. falciparum to describe short-term selective processes in this species and identify some candidate genes for balancing (diversifying) selection. Our analyses suggest that there are many functional elements in the non-genic regions of these genomes and that adaptive evolution has occurred more frequently in the protein-coding regions of the genome.},

These data come from many different DNA-sequencing technologies, each with their own platform-specific errors and biases, which vary widely. Several statistical studies have tried to measure error rates for basic determinations, but there are no general schemes to project these uncertainties so as to assess the surety of the conclusions drawn about genetic, epigenetic, and more general biological questions. We review here the state of uncertainty quantification in DNA sequencing applications, describe sources of error, and propose methods that can be used for accounting and propagating these errors and their uncertainties through subsequent calculations.},

In this study, we address the functional importance of this variation by comparing cardiac metabolism to patterns of mRNA expression using microarrays. There is extensive variation in both cardiac metabolism and the expression of metabolic genes among individuals of the teleost fish Fundulus heteroclitus from natural outbred populations raised in a common environment: metabolism differed among individuals by a factor of more than 2, and expression levels of 94\% of genes were significantly different (P < 0.01) between individuals in a population. This unexpectedly high variation in metabolic gene expression explains much of the variation in metabolism, suggesting that it is biologically relevant. The patterns of gene expression that are most important in explaining cardiac metabolism differ between groups of individuals. Apparently, the variation in metabolism seems to be related to different patterns of gene expression in the different groups of individuals. The magnitude of differences in gene expression in these groups is not important; large changes in expression have no greater predictive value than small changes. These data suggest that variation in physiological performance is related to the subtle variation in gene expression and that this relationship differs among individuals.},

The imprints of historic selection/adaptation episodes left in human and animal genomes allow one to interpret modern and ancestral gene origins and modifications. Current approaches to reveal selected regions applied in genome-wide selection scans (GWSSs) fall into eight principal categories: (I) phylogenetic footprinting, (II) detecting increased rates of functional mutations, (III) evaluating divergence versus polymorphism, (IV) detecting extended segments of linkage disequilibrium, (V) evaluating local reduction in genetic variation, (VI) detecting changes in the shape of the frequency distribution (spectrum) of genetic variation, (VII) assessing differentiating between populations (F(ST)), and (VIII) detecting excess or decrease in admixture contribution from one population. Here, we review and compare these approaches using available human genome-wide datasets to provide independent verification (or not) of regions found by different methods and using different populations. The lessons learned from GWSSs will be applied to identify genome signatures of historic selective pressures on genes and gene regions in other species with emerging genome sequences. This would offer considerable potential for genome annotation in functional, developmental and evolutionary contexts.},

  Abstract                 = {We use birdsong as a case study to ask whether reinforcement can occur via the spread of a genetically determined female preference for a socially inherited (learned) male trait. We envision secondary contact between two neighboring populations with different song dialects. An individual's ability to learn song is confined by a genetic predisposition: if predispositions are strong, there will be no phenotypic overlap in song between populations, whereas weak predispositions allow phenotypic overlap, or "mixed" song. To determine if reinforcement has occurred, we consider if an allele for within-population female mating preference, based on song, can spread, and whether population specific songs can concurrently be maintained at equilibrium. We model several scenarios, including costs to mating preferences, mating preferences in hybrids, and hybrids having the ability to learn pure songs. We find that when weak predispositions are fixed within a population reinforcement based on song cannot occur. However, when some individuals have strong predispositions, restricting phenotypic overlap between populations in the trait, reinforcement is only slightly inhibited from a purely genetic model. Generalizing beyond the example of song, we conclude that socially learned signals will tend to prohibit reinforcement, but it may still occur if some individuals acquire trait phenotypes genetically.},

  Abstract                 = {All eukaryotes have three nuclear DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, namely, Pol I, II, and III. Interestingly, plants have catalytic subunits for a fourth nuclear polymerase, Pol IV. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that Pol IV does not functionally overlap with Pol I, II, or III and is nonessential for viability. However, disruption of the Pol IV catalytic subunit genes NRPD1 or NRPD2 inhibits heterochromatin association into chromocenters, coincident with losses in cytosine methylation at pericentromeric 5S gene clusters and AtSN1 retroelements. Loss of CG, CNG, and CNN methylation in Pol IV mutants implicates a partnership between Pol IV and the methyltransferase responsible for RNA-directed de novo methylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, 5S gene and AtSN1 siRNAs are essentially eliminated in Pol IV mutants. The data suggest that Pol IV helps produce siRNAs that target de novo cytosine methylation events required for facultative heterochromatin formation and higher-order heterochromatin associations.},

In particular, these models assume that the distribution of fitness effects among new mutations is in the domain of attraction of the so-called Gumbel-type extreme value distribution. This assumption has not, however, been justified on any biological or theoretical grounds. In this note, I study random mutation in one of the simplest models of mutation and adaptation-Fisher's geometric model. I show that random mutation in this model yields a distribution of mutational effects that belongs to the Gumbel type. I also show that the distribution of fitness effects among rare beneficial mutations in Fisher's model is asymptotically exponential. I confirm these analytic findings with exact computer simulations. These results provide some support for the use of Gumbel-type extreme value theory in studies of adaptation and point to a surprising connection between recent phenotypic- and sequence-based models of adaptation: in both, the distribution of fitness effects among rare beneficial mutations is approximately exponential.},

These genes fall into several functional classes, although a role in transcriptional regulation could prove particularly common. More important, speciation genes are typically very rapidly evolving, and this divergence is often driven by positive Darwinian selection. Finally, I review recent work in Drosophila pseudoobscura on the possible role of meiotic drive in the evolution of the genes that cause postzygotic isolation.},

This probability, which is derived using extreme value theory, is independent of most biological details, including the length of the gene in question and the precise distribution of fitness effects among alleles. I conclude that the probability of parallel evolution under natural selection is nearly twice as large as that under neutrality.},

Following Gillespie (1983, 1984, 1991), I consider a population presently fixed for the ith best allele at a locus and study the sequential substitution of favorable mutations that results in fixation of the fittest DNA sequence locally available. Given a wild type sequence that is less than optimal, I derive the fitness rank of the next allele typically fixed by natural selection as well as the mean and variance of the jump in fitness that results when natural selection drives a substitution. Looking over the whole series of substitutions required to reach the best allele, I show that the mean fitness jumps occurring throughout an adaptive walk are constrained to a twofold window of values, assuming only that adaptation begins from a reasonably fit allele. I also show that the first substitution and the substitution of largest effect account for a large share of the total fitness increase during adaptation. I further show that the distribution of selection coefficients fixed throughout such an adaptive walk is exponential (ignoring mutations of small effect), a finding reminiscent of that seen in Fisher's geometric model of adaptation. Last, I show that adaptation by natural selection behaves in several respects as the average of two idealized forms of adaptation, perfect and random.},

  Abstract                 = {Species are separated by reproductive isolation as well as by more 'ordinary' differences in morphology and behavior that play no necessary role in blocking gene flow. Although a great deal is now known about the genetics of reproductive isolation, we are only beginning to understand the genetic basis of ordinary phenotypic differences between species. I review what is known about the number of genes involved in such differences, as well as about the role of major genes and epistasis in the evolution of these differences. I also compare and contrast these findings with those on the genetics of reproductive isolation.},

I propose a sign test that compares the observed number of plus and minus alleles in the "high line" with that expected under neutrality, conditioning on the known phenotypic difference between the taxa. Rejection of the null hypothesis implies a role for directional natural selection. This test is applicable to any character in any organism in which QTL analysis can be performed.},

Indeed, we can make no theoretical predictions, however heuristic, about the distribution of phenotypic effects among factors fixed during adaptation nor about the expected 'size' of the largest factor fixed. Study of this problem requires taking into account that populations gradually approach a phenotypic optimum during adaptation via the stepwise substitution of favorable mutations. Using Fisher's geometric model of adaptation, I analyze this approach to the optimum, and derive an approximate solution to the size distribution of factors fixed during adaptation. I further generalize these results to allow the input of any distribution of mutational effects. The distribution of factors fixed during adaptation assumes a pleasingly simple, exponential form. This result is remarkably insensitive to changes in the fitness function and in the distribution of mutational effects. An exponential trend among factors fixed appears to be a general property of adaptation toward a fixed optimum.},

Here I model speciation as the accumulation of genic incompatibilities between diverging populations. Several results are obtained. First, and most important, the number of genic incompatibilities between taxa increases much faster than linearly with time. In particular, the probability of speciation increases at least as fast as the square of the time since separation between two taxa. Second, as Muller realized, all hybrid incompatibilities must initially be asymmetric. Third, at loci that have diverged between taxa, evolutionarily derived alleles cause hybrid problems far more often than ancestral alleles. Last, it is "easier" to evolve complex hybrid incompatibilities requiring the simultaneous action of three or more loci than to evolve simple incompatibilities between pairs of genes. These results have several important implications for genetic analyses of speciation.},

Here I consider a possibility first suggested by Efroimson in 1932, by Muller in 1964 and by Crow and Kimura in 1965: diploidy may provide protection against somatic, not inherited, mutations. I both compare the mean fitness of haploid and diploid populations that are asexual and investigate the invasion of "diploidy" alleles in sexual populations. When deleterious mutations are partially recessive and somatic mutation is sufficiently common, somatic mutation provides a clear advantage to diploidy in both asexual and sexual species.},

Surprisingly, these hybrid males produce almost all daughters when crossed to females of any genotype (pure Bogota, pure USA, hybrid F1). Several lines of evidence suggest that this sex ratio distortion is caused by sex chromosome segregation distortion in hybrid males. We genetically analyze this normally cryptic segregation distortion and show that it involves several regions of the Bogota X chromosome that show strong epistatic interactions with each other. We further show that segregation distortion is normally masked within the Bogota subspecies by autosomal suppressors. Our analysis shows that the genetic basis of hybrid segregation distortion is similar to that of hybrid male sterility between the same subspecies. Indeed the severity of segregation distortion is correlated with the severity of sterility among hybrids. We discuss the possibility that hybrid sterility in this paradigmatic case of incipient speciation is caused by segregation distortion.},

The pathology of these hybrids closely resembles that of mitotic mutants in D. melanogaster. We use mosaic and cytological analyses to show that hybrid male inviability is associated with, and probably caused by, a defect in mitotic cell division. In the mosaic study, we find that male clones produced in otherwise female hybrids are not cell lethal but are very small, probably reflecting defects in mitotic proliferation. Cytological inspection of larval neuroblasts reveals a profound mitotic defect in hybrids: chromosomes show a near-complete failure to condense even after 2 hr of incubation in colchicine. Both the defect in clonal proliferation and in chromatin condensation are rescued by mutations known to rescue normally inviable hybrid males. We present a simple model in which hybrid inviability is partly or entirely caused by a mitotic defect; this defect is, in turn, caused by an interaction between the Hybrid male rescue (Hmr) locus of D. melanogaster and autosomal gene(s) from D. melanogaster's sister species.},

When divergence between populations is caused by genetic drift, we show that the time to speciation is independent of population subdivision: speciation occurs just as quickly in a species split into a few large populations as into many small populations. When divergence is driven by natural selection, however, the time to speciation is very sensitive to population subdivision and speciation occurs most rapidly when a species is split into two large populations. These results contradict several popular intuitions about the effect of population size on speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {Hybrid sterility and inviability often result from the accumulation of substitutions that, while functional on their normal genetic backgrounds, cause a loss of fitness when brought together in hybrids. Previous theory has shown that such Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities should accumulate at least as fast as the square of the number of substitutions separating two species, the so-called snowball effect. Here we explicitly describe the stochastic accumulation of these incompatibilities as a function of time. The accumulation of these incompatibilities involves three levels of stochasticity: (1) the number of substitutions separating two allopatric lineages at a given time; (2) the number of incompatibilities resulting from these substitutions; and (3) the fitness effects of individual incompatibilities. Previous analyses ignored the stochasticity of molecular evolution (level 1) as well as that due to the variable effects of incompatibilities (level 3). Here we approximate the full stochastic process characterizing the accumulation of hybrid incompatibilities between pairs of loci. We derive the distribution of the number of incompatibilities as a function of divergence time between allopatric taxa as well as the distribution of waiting times to speciation by postzygotic isolation. We provide simple approximations for the mean and variance of these waiting times. These results let us estimate. albeit crudely, the probability, p, that two diverged sites from different species will contribute to hybrid sterility or inviability. Our analyses of data from Drosophila and Bombina suggest that p is generally very small, on the order of 10(-6) or less.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently many exciting advances have been achieved in our understanding of Drosophila meiosis due to combined cytological and genetic approaches. New techniques have permitted the characterization of chromosome position and spindle formation in female meiosis I. The proteins encoded by the nod and ncd genes, two genes known to be needed for the proper partitioning of chromosomes lacking exchange events, have been identified and found to be kinesin-like motors. The effects of mutations in these genes on the spindle and chromosomes, together with the localization of the proteins, have yielded a model for the mechanism of female meiosis I. In male meiosis I, the chromosomal regions responsible for homolog pairing have been resolved to the level of specific DNA sequences. This provides a foundation for elucidating the molecular basis of meiotic pairing. The cytological techniques available in Drosophila also have permitted inroads into the regulation of sister-chromatid segregation. The products of two genes (mei-S332 and ord) essential for sister-chromatid cohesion have been identified recently. Additional advances in understanding Drosophila meiosis are the delineation of a functional centromere by using minichromosome derivatives and the identification of several regulatory genes for the meiotic cell cycle.},

Alleles conferring high or low assortative mating in D. pseudoobscura produce the same effects when inserted into D. persimilis. This observation suggests that the type of genetic variation that is most conducive to controversial modes of speciation with gene flow, such as reinforcement or sympatric speciation, is present in nature.},

  Abstract                 = {Pleiotropy is one of the most commonly observed attributes of genes. Yet the extent and influence of pleiotropy have been underexplored in population genetics models. In this paper, I quantify the extent to which pleiotropy inhibits the spread of alleles in response to directional selection on a focal trait. Under the assumption that pleiotropic effects are extensive and deleterious, the fraction of alleles that are beneficial overall is severely limited by pleiotropy and rises nearly linearly with the strength of directional selection on the focal trait. Over a broad class of distribution of pleiotropic effects, the mean selective effect of those alleles that are beneficial overall is halved, on average, by pleiotropy. The fraction of new mutant alleles that are beneficial overall and that succeed in fixing within a population is even more severely limited when directional selection is weak, but it rises quadratically with the strength of directional selection. Finally, the mean selective effect of mutant alleles that are beneficial and succeed in fixing is reduced by one-third, on average, by pleiotropy. These results help to shape our understanding of the evolutionary inertia caused by pleiotropy.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies have begun to reveal the genes underlying quantitative trait differences between closely related populations. Not all quantitative trait loci (QTL) are, however, equally likely to be detected. QTL studies involve a limited number of crosses, individuals, and genetic markers and, as a result, often have little power to detect genetic factors of small to moderate effects. In this article, we develop an estimator for the total number of fixed genetic differences between two parental lines. Like the Castle-Wright estimator, which is based on the observed segregation variance in classical crossbreeding experiments, our QTL-based estimator requires that a distribution be specified for the expected effect sizes of the underlying loci. We use this expected distribution and the observed mean and minimum effect size of the detected QTL in a likelihood model to estimate the total number of loci underlying the trait difference. We then test the QTL-based estimator and the Castle-Wright estimator in Monte Carlo simulations. When the assumptions of the simulations match those of the model, both estimators perform well on average. The 95\% confidence limits of the Castle-Wright estimator, however, often excluded the true number of underlying loci, while the confidence limits for the QTL-based estimator typically included the true value approximately 95\% of the time. Furthermore, we found that the QTL-based estimator was less sensitive to dominance and to allelic effects of opposite sign than the Castle-Wright estimator. We therefore suggest that the QTL-based estimator be used to assess how many loci may have been missed in QTL studies.},

One popular approach to infer whether the observed degree of population differentiation has been influenced by local adaptation is the comparison of neutral marker gene differentiation (as reflected in FST) and quantitative trait divergence (as reflected in QST). However, this method may lead to compromised statistical power, because FST and QST are summary statistics which neglect information on specific pairs of populations, and because current multivariate tests of neutrality involve an averaging procedure over the traits. Further, most FST-QST comparisons actually replace QST by its expectation over the evolutionary process and are thus theoretically flawed. To overcome these caveats, we derived the statistical distribution of population means generated by random genetic drift and used the probability density of this distribution to test whether the observed pattern could be generated by drift alone. We show that our method can differentiate between genetic drift and selection as a cause of population differentiation even in cases with FST=QST and demonstrate with simulated data that it disentangles drift from selection more accurately than conventional FST-QST tests especially when data sets are small.},

  Abstract                 = {During invasion, colonizing species can hybridize with native species, potentially swamping out native genomes. However, theory predicts that introgression will often be biased into the invading species. Thus, empirical estimates of gene flow between native and invasive species are important to quantify the actual threat of hybridization with invasive species. One classic example of introgression occurs in California, where Helianthus bolanderi was thought to be a hybrid between the serpentine endemic Helianthus exilis and the congeneric invader Helianthus annuus. We used genotyping by sequencing to look for signals of introgression and population structure. We find that H.¬†bolanderi and H.¬†exilis form one genetic clade, with weak population structure that is associated with geographic location rather than soil composition and likely represent a single species, not two. Additionally, while our results confirmed early molecular analysis and failed to support the hybrid origin of H.¬†bolanderi, we did find evidence for introgression mainly into the invader H.¬†annuus, as predicted by theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Divergent selection at ecologically important traits is thought to be a major factor driving phenotypic differentiation between populations. To elucidate the role of different evolutionary processes shaping the variation in gill raker number of European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus sensu lato) in the Baltic Sea basin, we assessed the relationships between genetic and phenotypic variation among and within three whitefish ecotypes (sea spawners, river spawners and lake spawners). To generate expected neutral distribution of FST and to evaluate whether highly variable microsatellite loci resulted in deflated FST estimates compared to less variable markers, we performed population genetic simulations under finite island and hierarchical island models. The genetic divergence observed among (FCT¬†=¬†0.010) and within (FST¬†=¬†0.014‚Äì0.041) ecotypes was rather low. The divergence in gill raker number, however, was substantially higher between sea and river spawners compared to observed microsatellite data and simulated neutral baseline (PCT¬†>¬†FCT). This suggests that the differences in gill raker number between sea and river spawners are likely driven by divergent natural selection. We also found strong support for divergent selection on gill raker number among different populations of sea spawners (PST¬†>¬†FST), most likely caused by highly variable habitat use and diverse diet. The putative role of divergent selection within lake spawners initially inferred from empirical microsatellite data was not supported by simulated FST distributions. This work provides a first formal test of divergent selection on gill raker number in Baltic whitefish, and demonstrates the usefulness of population genetic simulations to generate informative neutral baselines for PST‚ÄìFST analyses helping to disentangle the effects of stochastic evolutionary processes from natural selection.},

  Abstract                 = {Massively parallel sequencing offers an enormous potential for expression profiling, in particular for interspecific comparisons. Currently, different platforms for massively parallel sequencing are available, which differ in read length and sequencing costs. The 454-technology offers the highest read length. The other sequencing technologies are more cost effective, on the expense of shorter reads. Reliable expression profiling by massively parallel sequencing depends crucially on the accuracy to which the reads could be mapped to the corresponding genes.We performed an in silico analysis to evaluate whether incorrect mapping of the sequence reads results in a biased expression pattern. A comparison of six available mapping software tools indicated a considerable heterogeneity in mapping speed and accuracy. Independently of the software used to map the reads, we found that for compact genomes both short (35 bp, 50 bp) and long sequence reads (100 bp) result in an almost unbiased expression pattern. In contrast, for species with a larger genome containing more gene families and repetitive DNA, shorter reads (35-50 bp) produced a considerable bias in gene expression. In humans, about 10\% of the genes had fewer than 50\% of the sequence reads correctly mapped. Sequence polymorphism up to 9\% had almost no effect on the mapping accuracy of 100 bp reads. For 35 bp reads up to 3\% sequence divergence did not affect the mapping accuracy strongly. The effect of indels on the mapping efficiency strongly depends on the mapping software.In complex genomes, expression profiling by massively parallel sequencing could introduce a considerable bias due to incorrectly mapped sequence reads if the read length is short. Nevertheless, this bias could be accounted for if the genomic sequence is known. Furthermore, sequence polymorphisms and indels also affect the mapping accuracy and may cause a biased gene expression measurement. The choice of the mapping software is highly critical and the reliability depends on the presence/absence of indels and the divergence between reads and the reference genome. Overall, we found SSAHA2 and CLC to produce the most reliable mapping results.},

  Abstract                 = {Proteins on gamete surfaces are major determinants of fertilization success, particularly in free-spawning animals. Molecular analyses of these simple genetic systems show rapid evolution, positive selection, accelerated coalescence and, sometimes, extensive polymorphism. Careful analysis of the behavior of sperm produced by males with different gamete alleles shows that these alleles can deliver significant functional differences. Three forms of allele-specific fertilization advantage have been shown: assortative mating based on gamete type, rare allele advantage and heterozygote superiority. Models suggest that sperm and egg proteins may be coevolutionary partners that can alternate between directional selection for high fertilization ability and cyclic adaptation of eggs and sperm driven by sexual conflict. These processes act within allopatric populations and may accelerate their divergence if gamete adaptations in separate demes reduce cross-fertilization. Reproductive character displacement by reinforcement may play a diversifying role when previously allopatric populations rejoin. In circumstance that might prove to be common, divergence in sympatry can be driven by sexual conflict or by association of mating types with ecological differences. The ecology of fertilization, especially the degree of sperm competition and egg death via polyspermy, are important determinants of the strength and direction of selection on gametes. Free-spawning animals allow careful analysis of gamete recognition -from the behavior of adults and interactions of gametes, to molecular patterns of allele divergence. Future research efforts on the evolutionary consequences of fertilization ecology, and the interaction between extensive variation in egg surface proteins and sperm fertilization ability, are particularly needed.},

  Abstract                 = {It is well known that a phylogenetic tree (gene tree) constructed from DNA sequences for a genetic locus does not necessarily agree with the tree that represents the actual evolutionary pathway of the species involved (species tree). One of the important factors that cause this difference is genetic polymorphism in the ancestral species. Under the assumption of neutral mutations, this problem can be studied by evaluating the probability (P) that a gene tree has the same topology as that of the species tree. When one gene (allele) is used from each of the species involved, the probability can be expressed as a simple function of Ti = ti/(2N), where ti is the evolutionary time measured in generations for the ith internodal branch of the species tree and N is the effective population size. When any of the Ti's is less than 1, the probability P becomes considerably less than 1.0. This probability cannot be substantially increased by increasing the number of alleles sampled from a locus. To increase the probability, one has to use DNA sequences from many different loci that have evolved independently of each other.},

However, to utilize the potential of the method fully, many parameters affecting library quality and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery require optimization, especially for conifer genomes with a high repetitive DNA content. In this study, we explored strategies for effective GBS analysis in pine species. We constructed GBS libraries using HpaII, PstI and EcoRI-MseI digestions with different multiplexing levels and examined the effect of restriction enzymes on library complexity and the impact of sequencing depth and size selection of restriction fragments on sequence coverage bias. We tested and compared UNEAK, Stacks and GATK pipelines for the GBS data, and then developed a reference-free SNP calling strategy for haploid pine genomes. Our GBS procedure proved to be effective in SNP discovery, producing 7000‚Äì11¬†000 and 14¬†751 SNPs within and among three pine species, respectively, from a PstI library. This investigation provides guidance for the design and analysis of GBS experiments, particularly for organisms for which genomic information is lacking.},

Emerging evidence for variability in the coral calcification response to acidification, geographical variation in bleaching susceptibility and recovery, responses to past climate change, and potential rates of adaptation to rapid warming supports an alternative scenario in which reef degradation occurs with greater temporal and spatial heterogeneity than current projections suggest. Reducing uncertainty in projecting coral reef futures requires improved understanding of past responses to rapid climate change; physiological responses to interacting factors, such as temperature, acidification, and nutrients; and the costs and constraints imposed by acclimation and adaptation.},

Physical-space segregation of the sequencing platform into a fixed number of channels allows limited multiplexing, but obscures available sequencing space. To overcome these limitations, we have devised a novel barcoding approach to allow for pooling and sequencing of DNA from independent samples, and to facilitate subsequent segregation of sequencing capacity. Forty-eight forward-reverse barcode pairs are described: each forward and each reverse barcode unique with respect to at least 4 nt positions. With improved read lengths of pyrosequencers, combinations of forward and reverse barcodes may be used to sequence from as many as n(2) independent libraries for each set of 'n' forward and 'n' reverse barcodes, for each defined set of cloning-linkers. In two pilot series of barcoded sequencing using the GS20 Sequencer (454/Roche), we found that over 99.8\% of obtained sequences could be assigned to 25 independent, uniquely barcoded libraries based on the presence of either a perfect forward or a perfect reverse barcode. The false-discovery rate, as measured by the percentage of sequences with unexpected perfect pairings of unmatched forward and reverse barcodes, was estimated to be <0.005\%.},

  Abstract                 = {Pine cones that remain closed and retain seeds until fire causes the cones to open (cone serotiny) represent a key adaptive trait in a variety of pine species. In lodgepole pine, there is substantial geographical variation in serotiny across the Rocky Mountain region. This variation in serotiny has evolved as a result of geographically divergent selection, with consequences that extend to forest communities and ecosystems. An understanding of the genetic architecture of this trait is of interest owing to the wide-reaching ecological consequences of serotiny and also because of the repeated evolution of the trait across the genus. Here, we present and utilize an inexpensive and time-effective method for generating population genomic data. The method uses restriction enzymes and PCR amplification to generate a library of fragments that can be sequenced with a high level of multiplexing. We obtained data for more than 95?000 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 98 serotinous and nonserotinous lodgepole pines from three populations. \textbf{We used a Bayesian generalized linear model (GLM) to test for an association between genotypic variation at these loci and serotiny.} The probability of serotiny varied by genotype at 11 loci, and the association between genotype and serotiny at these loci was consistent in each of the three populations of pines. Genetic variation across these 11 loci explained 50\% of the phenotypic variation in serotiny. Our results provide a first genome-wide association map of serotiny in pines and demonstrate an inexpensive and efficient method for generating population genomic data.},

  Abstract                 = {Sequencing multiple copies of the ITS1 region revealed the coexistence of two or more haplotypes within the genome of Chorthippus parallelus. Using a PCR-RFLP approach, the ITS1 numbers and frequencies of haplotypes present in each of 40 individuals were investigated, revealing a consistent lack of homogeneity. For each individual, the level of intra-individual variation was estimated from a sample of 20 ITS1 copies. The level of differentiation in haplotype frequency among individuals was then estimated by maximum likelihood using models based on the Dirichlet distribution. This confirmed the existence of significant levels of variation among individuals within each population studied. The most likely turnover mechanism that could generate this pattern of variation is gene conversion, operating at the intrachromosomal level. Furthermore, the discovery of linkage disequilibrium among the ITS1 haplotypes of C. parallelus suggests that intrachromosomal gene conversion occurs more frequently than interchromosomal recombination. Subspecies of C. parallelus showed significantly different haplotype distributions following about 0.5 Myr of divergence. With respect to the process of concerted evolution, we show that homogenization of repeats is slow relative to speciation, and the standing variation among individuals is sufficient for selection to operate.},

 <title>Author Summary</title>
 <p>Despite the appearance of cooperation in nature, selection should often favor exploitative individuals who perform less of any cooperative behaviors while maintaining the benefits accrued from the cooperative behavior of others. This conflict of interest among cooperating individuals can lead to the evolution of complex social strategies that depend on the identity (e.g. genotype or strategy) of the individuals with whom you interact. The social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> provides a compelling model for studying such ‚Äúpartner specific‚Äù conflict and cooperation. Upon starvation, free-living amoebae aggregate and form a fruiting body composed of dead stalk cells and hardy spores. Different genotypes will aggregate to produce chimeric fruiting bodies, resulting in potential social conflict over who will contribute to the reproductive sporehead and who will ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù themselves to produce the dead stalk. The outcomes of competitive interactions in chimera appear complex, with social success being strongly partner specific. Here we propose a simple mechanism to explain social strategies in <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, based on the production of and response to stalk-inducing factors, the social signals that determine whether cells become stalk or spore. Indeed, measurements of signal production and response can predict social behavior of different strains, thus demonstrating a novel and elegantly simple underlying mechanistic basis for natural variation in complex facultative social strategies. This suggests that simple social rules can be sufficient to generate a diverse array of behavioral outcomes that appear complex and unpredictable when those rules are unknown.</p>

  Abstract                 = {A new generation of sequencing technologies is revolutionizing molecular biology. Illumina’s Solexa and Applied Biosystems’ SOLiD generate gigabases of nucleotide sequence per week. However, a perceived limitation of these ultra-high-throughput technologies is their short read-lengths. De novo assembly of sequence reads generated by classical Sanger capillary sequencing is a mature field of research. Unfortunately, the existing sequence assembly programs were not effective for short sequence reads generated by Illumina and SOLiD platforms. Early studies suggested that, in principle, sequence reads as short as 20–30 nucleotides could be used to generate useful assemblies of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome sequences, albeit containing many gaps. The early feasibility studies and proofs of principle inspired several bioinformatics research groups to implement new algorithms as freely available software tools specifically aimed at assembling reads of 30–50 nucleotides in length. This has led to the generation of several draft genome sequences based exclusively on short sequence Illumina sequence reads, recently culminating in the assembly of the 2.25-Gb genome of the giant panda from Illumina sequence reads with an average length of just 52 nucleotides. As well as reviewing recent developments in the field, we discuss some practical aspects such as data filtering and submission of assembly data to public repositories.},

We also describe the development of a new single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array consisting of 629,433 sites with clearly documented ascertainment that was specifically designed for population genetic analyses and that we genotyped in 934 individuals from 53 diverse populations. To illustrate the methods, we give a number of examples that provide new insights about the history of human admixture. The most striking finding is a clear signal of admixture into northern Europe, with one ancestral population related to present-day Basques and Sardinians and the other related to present-day populations of northeast Asia and the Americas. This likely reflects a history of admixture between Neolithic migrants and the indigenous Mesolithic population of Europe, consistent with recent analyses of ancient bones from Sweden and the sequencing of the genome of the Tyrolean "Iceman."},

We place the method on a solid statistical footing, using results from modern statistics to develop formal significance tests. We also uncover a general "phase change" phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

Human-chimpanzee genetic divergence varies from less than 84\% to more than 147\% of the average, a range of more than 4 million years. Our analysis also shows that human-chimpanzee speciation occurred less than 6.3 million years ago and probably more recently, conflicting with some interpretations of ancient fossils. Most strikingly, chromosome X shows an extremely young genetic divergence time, close to the genome minimum along nearly its entire length. These unexpected features would be explained if the human and chimpanzee lineages initially diverged, then later exchanged genes before separating permanently.},

Specifically, we address the following questions: Why study the effects of GCC on intraspecific genetic diversity? How does GCC affect genetic diversity? How is the effect of GCC on genetic diversity currently studied? Where is potential for future research? For each of these questions, we provide a general background and highlight case studies across the animal, plant and microbial kingdoms. We further discuss how cryptic diversity can affect GCC assessments, how genetic diversity can be integrated into studies that aim to predict species' responses on GCC and how conservation efforts related to GCC can incorporate and profit from inclusion of genetic diversity assessments. We argue that studying the fate of intraspecifc genetic diversity is an indispensable and logical venture if we are to fully understand the consequences of GCC on biodiversity on all levels.},

  Abstract                 = {A complete understanding of the speciation process requires the identification of genomic regions and genes that confer reproductive barriers between species. Empirical and theoretical research has revealed two important patterns in the evolution of reproductive isolation in animals: isolation typically arises as a result of disrupted epistatic interactions between multiple loci and these disruptions map disproportionately to the X chromosome. These patterns suggest that a targeted examination of natural gene flow between closely related species at X-linked markers with known positions would provide insight into the genetic basis of speciation. We take advantage of the existence of genomic data and a well-documented European zone of hybridization between two species of house mice, Mus domesticus and M. musculus, to conduct such a survey. We evaluate patterns of introgression across the hybrid zone for 13 diagnostic X-linked loci with known chromosomal positions using a maximum likelihood model. Interlocus comparisons clearly identify one locus with reduced introgression across the center of the hybrid zone, pinpointing a candidate region for reproductive isolation. Results also reveal one locus with high frequencies of M. domesticus alleles in populations on the M. musculus side of the zone, suggesting the possibility that positive selection may act to drive the spread of alleles from one species on to the genomic background of the other species. Finally, cline width and cline center are strongly positively correlated across the X chromosome, indicating that gene flow of the X chromosome may be asymmetrical.

  Abstract                 = {Hybridization among diverging lineages is common in nature. Genomic data provide a special opportunity to characterize the history of hybridization and the genetic basis of speciation. We review existing methods and empirical studies to identify recent advances in the genomics of hybridization, as well as issues that need to be addressed. Notable progress has been made in the development of methods for detecting hybridization and inferring individual ancestries. However, few approaches reconstruct the magnitude and timing of gene flow, estimate the fitness of hybrids or incorporate knowledge of recombination rate. Empirical studies indicate that the genomic consequences of hybridization are complex, including a highly heterogeneous landscape of differentiation. Inferred characteristics of hybridization differ substantially among species groups. Loci showing unusual patterns ‚Äì which may contribute to reproductive barriers ‚Äì are usually scattered throughout the genome, with potential enrichment in sex chromosomes and regions of reduced recombination. We caution against the growing trend of interpreting genomic variation in summary statistics across genomes as evidence of differential gene flow. We argue that converting genomic patterns into useful inferences about hybridization will ultimately require models and methods that directly incorporate key ingredients of speciation, including the dynamic nature of gene flow, selection acting in hybrid populations and recombination rate variation.},

  Abstract                 = {Little is known about the physiological responses and genetic mutations associated with reproductive isolation between species, especially for postmating prezygotic isolating barriers. Here, we examine changes in gene expression that accompany the expression of ‚Äòunilateral incompatibility‚Äô (UI)‚Äîa postmating prezygotic barrier in which fertilization is prevented by gamete rejection in the reproductive tract [in this case of pollen tubes (male gametophytes)] in one direction of a species cross, but is successful in the reciprocal crossing direction. We use whole-transcriptome sequencing of multiple developmental stages of male and female tissues in two Solanum species that exhibit UI to: (i) identify transcript differences between UI-competent and UI noncompetent tissues; (ii) characterize transcriptional changes specifically associated with the phenotypic expression of UI; and (iii) using these comparisons, evaluate the behaviour of a priori candidate loci for UI and identify new candidates for future manipulative work. In addition to describing transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression that accompany this isolating barrier, we identify at least five strong candidates for involvement in postmating prezygotic incompatibility between species. These include three novel candidates and two candidates that are strongly supported by prior developmental, functional, and quantitative trait locus mapping studies. These latter genes are known molecular players in the intraspecific expression of mate choice via genetic self-incompatibility, and our study supports prior evidence that these inter- and intraspecific postmating prezygotic reproductive behaviours share specific genetic and molecular mechanisms.},

Here we review the literature covering speciation through host-plant specialisation in a well-studied model, the pea aphid complex, Acyrthosiphon pisum, which encompasses numerous biotypes that parasitise different legume host species worldwide. 3. Published results are consistent with ecologically promoted reproductive isolation. Divergent host-induced selection is pronounced across biotypes, and reflects genetic trade-offs preventing the optimal use of multiple host plants. While these genetic trade-offs may partly explain the unfitness of hybrids between biotypes, hybridisation occurring on plants is also limited by genetically-based host preference, and by selection against migrants that chose unfavourable hosts. The continuum of genetic divergence displayed by 11 races and species of the pea aphid complex suggests that host races constitute an intermediate step in the speciation process, and that host specialisation may indeed lead to complete speciation. Uncertainties remain on the contribution of non-ecological reproductive barriers to biotype divergence and on the physiological and molecular bases of host specialisation.},

  Abstract                 = {The origin of tropical forest diversity has been hotly debated for decades. Although specific mechanisms vary, many such explanations propose some vicariance in the distribution of species during glacial cycles and several have been supported by genetic evidence in Neotropical taxa. However, no consensus exists with regard to the extent or time frame of the vicariance events. Here, we analyse the cytochrome oxidase II mitochondrial gene of 250 Sabethes albiprivus B mosquitoes sampled from western Sao Paulo in Brazil. There was very low population structuring among collection sites (Phi(ST)=0.03, P=0.04). Historic demographic analyses and the contemporary geographic distribution of genetic diversity suggest that the populations sampled are not at demographic equilibrium. Three distinct mitochondrial clades were observed in the samples, one of which differed significantly in its geographic distribution relative to the other two within a small sampling area (approximately 70 x 35 km). This fact, supported by the inability of maximum likelihood analyses to achieve adequate fits to simple models for the population demography of the species, suggests a more complex history, possibly involving disjunct forest refugia. This hypothesis is supported by a genetic signal of recent population growth, which is expected if population sizes of this forest-obligate insect increased during the forest expansions that followed glacial periods. Although a time frame cannot be reliably inferred for the vicariance event leading to the three genetic clades, molecular clock estimates place this at approximately 1 Myr before present.},

Thirty-four exons, distributed over 45 kb of genomic sequence, have been identified and mapped, including exons in three regions involved in alternative splicing and new sites potentially involved in RNA editing. The comparison of the intron/exon boundaries of this channel with a mammalian counterpart shows that the genomic structure of these two genes has remained fairly similar during evolution, with more than half of the Drosophila intron positions being perfectly conserved compared to the human channel. Phylogenetic analysis of the mutually exclusive alternative exons revealed that they have diverged considerably. It is suggested that this divergence, rather than reflecting evolutionary age, is the likely result of accelerated rates of evolution following duplication.},

However, both technologies suffer from the problem that sequencing depth of different regions of a genome or genomes from different species are highly uneven. Most existing genome assemblers usually have an assumption that sequencing depths are even. These assemblers fail to construct correct long contigs.We introduce the IDBA-UD algorithm that is based on the de Bruijn graph approach for assembling reads from single-cell sequencing or metagenomic sequencing technologies with uneven sequencing depths. Several non-trivial techniques have been employed to tackle the problems. Instead of using a simple threshold, we use multiple depthrelative thresholds to remove erroneous k-mers in both low-depth and high-depth regions. The technique of local assembly with paired-end information is used to solve the branch problem of low-depth short repeat regions. To speed up the process, an error correction step is conducted to correct reads of high-depth regions that can be aligned to highconfident contigs. Comparison of the performances of IDBA-UD and existing assemblers (Velvet, Velvet-SC, SOAPdenovo and Meta-IDBA) for different datasets, shows that IDBA-UD can reconstruct longer contigs with higher accuracy.The IDBA-UD toolkit is available at our website http://www.cs.hku.hk/~alse/idba_ud},

In this study, we present a combination of analytical and simulation results to demonstrate the effect of adaptation from recurrent mutation on summary statistics for polymorphism data from a linked neutral locus. We also analyze the power of standard neutrality tests based on the frequency spectrum or on linkage disequilibrium (LD) under this scenario. For recurrent beneficial mutation at biologically realistic rates, we find substantial deviations from the classical pattern of a selective sweep from a single new mutation. Deviations from neutrality in the level of polymorphism and in the frequency spectrum are much less pronounced than in the classical sweep pattern. In contrast, for levels of LD, the signature is even stronger if recurrent beneficial mutation plays a role. We suggest a variant of existing LD tests that increases their power to detect this signature.},

In this case, descendants of several of these independent origins may contribute to the fixation. As a consequence, all ancestral haplotypes that are linked to any of these copies will be retained in the population, affecting the pattern of a selective sweep on linked neutral variation. In this study, we use analytical calculations based on coalescent theory and computer simulations to analyze molecular adaptation from recurrent mutation or migration. Under the assumption of complete linkage, we derive a robust analytical approximation for the number of ancestral haplotypes and their distribution in a sample from the population. We find that so-called "soft sweeps," where multiple ancestral haplotypes appear in a sample, are likely for biologically realistic values of mutation or migration rates.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>The ability to efficiently and accurately determine genotypes is a keystone technology in modern genetics, crucial to studies ranging from clinical diagnostics, to genotype-phenotype association, to reconstruction of ancestry and the detection of selection. To date, high capacity, low cost genotyping has been largely achieved via âSNP chipâ microarray-based platforms which require substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence and variability, and once designed are suitable only for those targeted variable nucleotide sites. This method introduces substantial ascertainment bias and inherently precludes detection of rare or population-specific variants, a major source of information for both population history and genotype-phenotype association. Recent developments in reduced-representation genome sequencing experiments on massively parallel sequencers (commonly referred to as RAD-tag or RADseq) have brought direct sequencing to the problem of population genotyping, but increased cost and procedural and analytical complexity have limited their widespread adoption. Here, we describe a complete laboratory protocol, including a custom combinatorial indexing method, and accompanying software tools to facilitate genotyping across large numbers (hundreds or more) of individuals for a range of markers (hundreds to hundreds of thousands). Our method requires no prior genomic knowledge and achieves per-site and per-individual costs below that of current SNP chip technology, while requiring similar hands-on time investment, comparable amounts of input DNA, and downstream analysis times on the order of hours. Finally, we provide empirical results from the application of this method to both genotyping in a laboratory cross and in wild populations. Because of its flexibility, this modified RADseq approach promises to be applicable to a diversity of biological questions in a wide range of organisms.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {During the Pleistocene, the habitat of the noctule bat (Nyctalus noctula) was limited to small refuge areas located in Southern Europe, whereas the species is now widespread across this continent. Using mtDNA (control region and ND1 gene) polymorphisms, we asked whether this recolonization occurred through bottlenecks and whether it was accompanied by population growth. Sequences of the second hypervariable domain of the control region were obtained from 364 noctule bats representing 18 colonies sampled across Europe. This yielded 108 haplotypes that were depicted on a minimum spanning tree that showed a starlike structure with two long branches. Additional sequences obtained from the ND1 gene confirmed that the different parts of the MST correspond to three clades which diverged before the Last Glacial Maximum (18,000 yrC<sup>14</sup> BP), leading to the conclusion that the noctule bat survived in several isolated refugia. Partitioning populations into coherent geographical groups divided our samples (?<sub>CT</sub> = 0.17; P = 0.01) into a group of highly variable nursing colonies from central and eastern Europe and less variable, isolated colonies from western and southern Europe. Demographic analyses suggest that populations of the former group underwent demographic expansions either after the Younger Dryas (11,000-10,000 yrC<sup>14</sup> BP), assuming a fast mutation rate for HV II, or during the Pleistocene, assuming a conventional mutation rate. We discuss the fact that the high genetic variability (h = 0.69-0.96; ? = 0.006-0.013) observed in nursing colonies that are located some distance from potential Pleistocene refugia is probably due to the combined effect of rapid evolution of the control region in growing populations and a range shift of noctule populations parallel to the recovery of forests in Europe after the last glaciations.},

  Abstract                 = {Gene flow between genetically distinct populations creates linkage disequilibrium (admixture linkage disequilibrium [ALD]) among all loci (linked and unlinked) that have different allele frequencies in the founding populations. We have explored the distribution of ALD by using computer simulation of two extreme models of admixture: the hybrid-isolation (HI) model, in which admixture occurs in a single generation, and the continuous-gene-flow (CGF) model, in which admixture occurs at a steady rate in every generation. Linkage disequilibrium patterns in African American population samples from Jackson, MS, and from coastal South Carolina resemble patterns observed in the simulated CGF populations, in two respects. First, significant association between two loci (FY and AT3) separated by 22 cM was detected in both samples. The retention of ALD over relatively large (>10 cM) chromosomal segments is characteristic of a CGF pattern of admixture but not of an HI pattern. Second, significant associations were also detected between many pairs of unlinked loci, as observed in the CGF simulation results but not in the simulated HI populations. Such a high rate of association between unlinked markers in these populations could result in false-positive linkage signals in an admixture-mapping study. However, we demonstrate that by conditioning on parental admixture, we can distinguish between true linkage and association resulting from shared ancestry. Therefore, populations with a CGF history of admixture not only are appropriate for admixture mapping but also have greater power for detection of linkage disequilibrium over large chromosomal regions than do populations that have experienced a pattern of admixture more similar to the HI model, if methods are employed that detect and adjust for disequilibrium caused by continuous admixture.},

  Abstract                 = {A mapping population was created to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis subsp. graminicola in Lolium perenne. A susceptible and a resistant plant were crossed to produce a pseudo-testcross population of 193 F(1) individuals. Markers were produced by the restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) process, which uses massively parallel and multiplexed sequencing of reduced-representation libraries. Additional simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers were combined with the RAD markers to produce maps for the female (738 cM) and male (721 cM) parents. Stem rust phenotypes (number of pustules per plant) were determined in replicated greenhouse trials by inoculation with a field-collected, genetically heterogeneous population of urediniospores. The F(1) progeny displayed continuous distribution of phenotypes and transgressive segregation. We detected three resistance QTL. The most prominent QTL (qLpPg1) is located near 41 cM on linkage group (LG) 7 with a 2-LOD interval of 8 cM, and accounts for 30-38\% of the stem rust phenotypic variance. QTL were detected also on LG1 (qLpPg2) and LG6 (qLpPg3), each accounting for approximately 10\% of phenotypic variance. Alleles of loci closely linked to these QTL originated from the resistant parent for qLpPg1 and from both parents for qLpPg2 and qLpPg3. Observed quantitative nature of the resistance may be due to partial-resistance effects against all pathogen genotypes, or qualitative effects completely preventing infection by only some genotypes in the genetically mixed inoculum. RAD markers facilitated rapid construction of new genetic maps in this outcrossing species and will enable development of sequence-based markers linked to stem rust resistance in L. perenne.},

Yet its evolutionary significance remains controversial, especially in regard to whether and how it impacts diversification and speciation. Here, we review recent theory on how plasticity promotes: (i) the origin of novel phenotypes, (ii) divergence among populations and species, (iii) the formation of new species and (iv) adaptive radiation. We also discuss the latest empirical support for each of these evolutionary pathways to diversification and identify potentially profitable areas for future research.

Contrary to these expectations, female spadefoot toads were more likely to choose heterospecific males when exposed to environmental conditions that favor hybridization. Indeed, those females with phenotypic characteristics for which hybridization is most favorable were most likely to switch from choosing conspecifics to heterospecifics. Moreover, environmentally dependent mate choice has evolved only in populations and species that risk engaging in, and can potentially benefit from, hybridization. Thus, when the benefits of mate choice vary, females may radically alter their mate selection in response to their own phenotype and their environment, even to the point of choosing males of other species.},

  Abstract                 = {Interactions with heterospecifics can promote the evolution of divergent mating behaviours between populations that do and do not occur with heterospecifics. This process--reproductive character displacement--potentially results from selection to minimize the risk of mating with heterospecifics. We sought to determine whether heterospecific interactions lead to divergence of female preferences for aspects of conspecific male signals. We used artificial neural network models to simulate a mate recognition system in which females co-occur with different heterospecifics in different populations. Populations that evolved conspecific recognition in the presence of different heterospecifics varied in their preferences for aspects of conspecific male signals. When we tested networks for their preferences of conspecific versus heterospecific signals, however, we found that networks from allopatric populations were usually able to select against heterospecifics. We suggest that female preferences for aspects of conspecific male signals can result in a concomitant reduction in the likelihood that females will mate with heterospecifics. Consequently, even females in allopatry may discriminate against heterospecific mates depending on the nature of their preferences for conspecifics. Such a pattern could potentially explain cases where reproductive character displacement is expected, but not observed.},

  Abstract                 = {Cell-specific gene expression is a fundamental area of investigation of various disciplines, but is often complicated by cell heterogeneity, paucity of material, or limits of detection for low-abundance mRNAs. Antisense RNA (aRNA) amplification presents a linear amplification method for analyzing the mRNA population from single living cells. Patch clamp electrodes containing reverse transcriptase, dNTPS, and a poly(T) primer modified 5' with a T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence are used to isolate the cytoplasmic contents of individual living cells. The cDNAs transcribed therefore contain the T7 promoter sequence. Following subsequent processing for second-strand cDNA synthesis, T7 polymerase is used for amplification, which results in a 2000-fold amplification of antisense RNA. A second round of amplification results in a 106-fold amplification of the initial material. The aRNA amplification method may be used in conjunction with other techniques. Electrophysiology may be conducted first to examine functional properties. Reverse Northerns may be performed, using the aRNA as a probe to identify specific cDNAs loaded onto a slot blot. PCR may be conducted to determine splice variants. Differential display and library construction may be employed to identify unknown or novel genes. Thus, the aRNA amplification may prove a valuable method for providing information on cell-specific gene expression in a variety of studies.},

  Abstract                 = {A key issue in development is how to specify single isolated precursor cells to adopt a distinct fate from a group of naive cells. Studies on the development of Drosophila external sensory (ES) organs have revealed multiple mechanisms to specify single sensory organ precursors (SOPs) from clusters of cells with equivalent neural potential. Initially single SOPs are selected in part through cell-cell competition from clusters of ectodermal cells that express proneural proteins. To reinforce the singularity, lateral inhibition through the Delta/Notch system and feedback regulations lead to exclusive expression of proneural proteins in SOPs. As transcriptional activators, proneural proteins execute a genetic program in SOP cells for the development of an eventually ES organ. In this article, we will summarize recent advances on how transcriptional regulation, protein degradation, endocytosis and gene silencing by microRNA participate in SOP specification.},

Poelstra et al. sequenced genes from two species of central European crows: gray-bodied hooded crows and black carrion crows (see the Perspective by de Knijff). Although most of the genomes shared genes between the two species, one region that affected coat color and color vision differed. The authors suggest that black and gray-coated crows prefer to mate with birds like themselves.Science, this issue p. 1410; see also p. 1345 The importance, extent, and mode of interspecific gene flow for the evolution of species has long been debated. Characterization of genomic differentiation in a classic example of hybridization between all-black carrion crows and gray-coated hooded crows identified genome-wide introgression extending far beyond the morphological hybrid zone. Gene expression divergence was concentrated in pigmentation genes expressed in gray versus black feather follicles. Only a small number of narrow genomic islands exhibited resistance to gene flow. One prominent genomic region (\&lt;2 megabases) harbored 81 of all 82 fixed differences (of 8.4 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms in total) linking genes involved in pigmentation and in visual perception{\textemdash}a genomic signal reflecting color-mediated prezygotic isolation. Thus, localized genomic selection can cause marked heterogeneity in introgression landscapes while maintaining phenotypic divergence.},

In contrast to other articles showing analytical formulas for frequencies of SNPs, we derive expressions that contain coefficients that do not explode when the genealogy size increases. We also provide analytical formulas to describe the way in which the ascertainment procedure modifies SNP distributions. Using our methods, we study the power to test the hypothesis of exponential population expansion vs. the hypothesis of evolution with constant population size. We also analyze some of the available SNP data and we compare our results of demographic parameters estimation to those obtained in previous studies in population genetics. The analyzed data seem consistent with the hypothesis of past population growth of modern humans. The analysis of the data also shows a very strong sensitivity of estimated demographic parameters to changes of the model of the ascertainment procedure.},

Having accurate techniques for determining dietary ranges and components is critical for this endeavour. While visual analyses and early molecular approaches are highly labour intensive and often lack resolution, recent DNA-based approaches potentially provide more accurate methods for dietary studies. A suite of approaches have been used based on the identification of consumed species by characterization of DNA present in gut or faecal samples. In one approach, a standardized DNA region (DNA barcode) is PCR amplified, amplicons are sequenced and then compared to a reference database for identification. Initially, this involved sequencing clones from PCR products, and studies were limited in scale because of the costs and effort required. The recent development of next generation sequencing (NGS) has made this approach much more powerful, by allowing the direct characterization of dozens of samples with several thousand sequences per PCR product, and has the potential to reveal many consumed species simultaneously (DNA metabarcoding). Continual improvement of NGS technologies, on-going decreases in costs and current massive expansion of reference databases make this approach promising. Here we review the power and pitfalls of NGS diet methods. We present the critical factors to take into account when choosing or designing a suitable barcode. Then, we consider both technical and analytical aspects of NGS diet studies. Finally, we discuss the validation of data accuracy including the viability of producing quantitative data.},

We have sequenced more than 100 D. melanogaster genomes originating from sub-Saharan Africa, which is thought to contain the ancestral range of this model organism. We found evidence for recent and substantial non-African gene flow into African populations, which may be driven by natural selection. The data also helped to refine our understanding of the species' history, which may have involved a geographic expansion from southern central Africa (e.g. Zambia). Lastly, we identified a large number of genes and functions that may have experienced recent adaptive evolution in one or more populations. An understanding of genomic variation in ancestral range populations of D. melanogaster will improve our ability to make population genetic inferences for worldwide populations. The results presented here should motivate statistical, mathematical, and computational studies to identify evolutionary models that are most compatible with observed data. Finally, the potential signals of natural selection identified here should facilitate detailed follow-up studies on the genetic basis of adaptive evolutionary change.},

  Abstract                 = {After migrant chromosomes enter a population, they are progressively sliced into smaller pieces by recombination. Therefore, the length distribution of "migrant tracts" (chromosome segments with recent migrant ancestry) contains information about historical patterns of migration. Here we introduce a theoretical framework describing the migrant tract length distribution and propose a likelihood inference method to test demographic hypotheses and estimate parameters related to a historical change in migration rate. Applying this method to data from the hybridizing subspecies Mus musculus domesticus and M. m. musculus, we find evidence for an increase in the rate of hybridization. Our findings could indicate an evolutionary trajectory toward fusion rather than speciation in these taxa.},

It has been shown that population size changes alter the ratio of X linked to autosomal (X/A) variation, with population size reductions and recent bottlenecks leading to decreased X/A diversity ratios. Here we use theory and simulation to investigate a separate demographic effect-that of founder events involving multiply mated females-and find that it leads to much stronger reductions in X/A diversity ratios than are produced by simple population size changes. Investigating the potential of this process to account for sharply reduced X-linked diversity in European Drosophila melanogaster, we find that this model yields predictions that are compatible with the empirical data.},

  Abstract                 = {The Eurasian badger (Meles meles) has been implicated in the transmission of bovine tuberculosis (TB, caused by Mycobacterium bovis) to cattle. However, evidence suggests that attempts to reduce the spread of TB among cattle in Britain by culling badgers have mixed effects. A large-scale field experiment (the randomized badger culling trial, RBCT) showed that widespread proactive badger culling reduced the incidence of TB in cattle within culled areas but that TB incidence increased in adjoining areas. Additionally, localized reactive badger culling increased the incidence of TB in cattle. It has been suggested that culling-induced perturbation of badger social structure may increase individual movements and elevate the risk of disease transmission between badgers and cattle. Field studies support this hypothesis, by demonstrating increases in badger group ranges and the prevalence of TB infection in badgers following culling. However, more evidence on the effect of culling on badger movements is needed in order to predict the epidemiological consequences of this control strategy. Here, analysis of the genetic signatures of badger populations in the RBCT revealed increased dispersal following culling. While standard tests provided evidence for greater dispersal after culling, a novel method indicated that this was due to medium- and long-distance dispersal, in addition to previously reported increases in home-range size. Our results also indicated that, on average, badgers infected with M. bovis moved significantly farther than did uninfected badgers. A disease control strategy that included culling would need to take account of the potentially negative epidemiological consequences of increased badger dispersal.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies of related populations varying in their degrees of reproductive isolation can provide insights into speciation. Here, the transition from partially isolated host races to more fully separated sibling species is investigated by comparing patterns of genetic differentiation between recently evolved (∼150 generations) apple and ancestral hawthorn-infesting populations of Rhagoletis pomonella to their sister taxon, the undescribed flowering dogwood fly attacking Cornus florida. No fixed or diagnostic private alleles differentiating the three populations were found at any of 23 microsatellites and 10 allozymes scored. Nevertheless, allele frequency differences were sufficient across loci for flowering dogwood fly populations from multiple localities to form a diagnosable genotypic cluster distinct from apple and hawthorn flies, indicative of species status. Genome-wide patterns of differentiation were correlated between the host races and species pair comparisons along the majority of chromosomes, suggesting that similar disruptive selection pressures affect most loci. However, differentiation was more pronounced, with some additional regions showing elevated divergence, for the species pair comparison. Our results imply that Rhagoletis sibling species such as the flowering dogwood fly represent host races writ large, with the transition to species status primarily resulting from increased divergence of the same regions separating apple and hawthorn flies.},

  Abstract                 = {Population stratification--allele frequency differences between cases and controls due to systematic ancestry differences-can cause spurious associations in disease studies. We describe a method that enables explicit detection and correction of population stratification on a genome-wide scale. Our method uses principal components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls. The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations. Our simple, efficient approach can easily be applied to disease studies with hundreds of thousands of markers.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a model-based clustering method for using multilocus genotype data to infer population structure and assign individuals to populations. We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

A serious problem with association mapping is that population structure can lead to spurious associations between a candidate marker and a phenotype. One common solution has been to abandon case-control studies in favor of family-based tests of association, such as the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT), but this comes at a considerable cost in the need to collect DNA from close relatives of affected individuals. In this article we describe a novel, statistically valid, method for case-control association studies in structured populations. Our method uses a set of unlinked genetic markers to infer details of population structure, and to estimate the ancestry of sampled individuals, before using this information to test for associations within subpopulations. It provides power comparable with the TDT in many settings and may substantially outperform it if there are conflicting associations in different subpopulations.},

Fossil records suggest that many species survived glacial maxima by retreating to refugia, usually at lower latitudes. Recently, phylogeographic studies have given support to the existence of previously unknown, or cryptic, refugia. Here we summarise many of these insights into the glacial histories of species in cryptic refugia gained through phylogeographic approaches. Understanding such refugia might be important as the Earth heads into another period of climate change, in terms of predicting the effects on species distribution and survival. },

In this study, we used a RAD (Restriction site Associated DNA) sequencing approach to identify species-specific diagnostic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and design a low-density array that combined with screening of a diagnostic mitochondrial DNA marker. Eels from Iceland (N=159) and from the neighboring Faroe Islands (N=29) were genotyped, along with 94 larvae (49 European and 45 American eel) collected in the Sargasso Sea. Our SNP survey showed that the majority of Icelandic eels are pure European eels but there is also an important contribution of individuals of admixed ancestry (10.7\%). Although most of the hybrids were identified as F1 hybrids from European eel female × American eel male crosses, backcrosses were also detected, including a first-generation backcross (F1 hybrid × pure European eel) and three individuals identified as second-generation backcrosses originating from American eel × F1 hybrid backcrosses interbreeding with pure European eels. In comparison, no hybrids were observed in the Faroe Islands, the closest bodies of land to Iceland. It is possible that hybrids show an intermediate migratory behaviour between the two parental species that ultimately brings hybrid larvae to the shores of Iceland, situated roughly halfway between the Sargasso Sea and Europe. Only two hybrids were observed among Sargasso Sea larvae, both backcrosses, but no F1 hybrids, that points to temporal variation in the occurrence of hybridization.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing and the collection of genome-wide data allow identifying adaptive variation and footprints of directional selection. Using a large SNP data set from 259 RAD-sequenced European eel individuals (glass eels) from eight locations between 34 and 64(o) N, we examined the patterns of genome-wide genetic diversity across locations. We tested for local selection by searching for increased population differentiation using F(ST) -based outlier tests and by testing for significant associations between allele frequencies and environmental variables. The overall low genetic differentiation found (F(ST) = 0.0007) indicates that most of the genome is homogenized by gene flow, providing further evidence for genomic panmixia in the European eel. The lack of genetic substructuring was consistent at both nuclear and mitochondrial SNPs. Using an extensive number of diagnostic SNPs, results showed a low occurrence of hybrids between European and American eel, mainly limited to Iceland (5.9\%), although individuals with signatures of introgression several generations back in time were found in mainland Europe. Despite panmixia, a small set of SNPs showed high genetic differentiation consistent with single-generation signatures of spatially varying selection acting on glass eels. After screening 50 354 SNPs, a total of 754 potentially locally selected SNPs were identified. Candidate genes for local selection constituted a wide array of functions, including calcium signalling, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and circadian rhythm. Remarkably, one of the candidate genes identified is PERIOD, possibly related to differences in local photoperiod associated with the >30° difference in latitude between locations. Genes under selection were spread across the genome, and there were no large regions of increased differentiation as expected when selection occurs within just a single generation due to panmixia. This supports the conclusion that most of the genome is homogenized by gene flow that removes any effects of diversifying selection from each new generation.},

We generated a unique resource of novel SNP markers for the European eel using the RAD sequencing approach that was simultaneously identified and scored in a genome-wide scan of 30 individuals. Whereas genomic resources are increasingly becoming available for this species, including the recent release of a draft genome, no genome-wide set of SNP markers was available until now. The generated SNPs were widely distributed across the eel genome, aligning to 4779 different contigs and 19,703 different scaffolds. Significant variation was identified, with an average nucleotide diversity of 0.00529 across individuals. Results varied widely across the genome, ranging from 0.00048 to 0.00737 per locus. Based on the average nucleotide diversity across all loci, long-term effective population size was estimated to range between 132,000 and 1,320,000, which is much higher than previous estimates based on microsatellite loci. The generated SNP resource consisting of 82,425 loci and 376,918 associated SNPs provides a valuable tool for future population genetics and genomics studies and allows for targeting specific genes and particularly interesting regions of the eel genome.},

  Abstract                 = {Massively parallel sequencing a small proportion of the whole genome at high coverage enables answering a wide range of questions from molecular evolution and evolutionary biology to animal and plant breeding and forensics. In this study, we describe the development of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing approach for Ion Torrent PGM platform. Our protocol results in extreme genome complexity reduction using two rare-cutting restriction enzymes and strict size selection of the library allowing sequencing of a relatively small number of genomic fragments with high sequencing depth. We applied this approach to a common freshwater fish species, the Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis L.), and generated over 2.2 MB of novel sequence data consisting of ~17¬†000 contigs, identified 1259 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We also estimated genetic differentiation between the DNA pools from freshwater (Lake Peipus) and brackish water (the Baltic Sea) populations and identified SNPs with the strongest signal of differentiation that could be used for robust individual assignment in the future. This work represents an important step towards developing genomic resources and genetic tools for the Eurasian perch. We expect that our ddRAD sequencing protocol for semiconductor sequencing technology will be useful alternative for currently available RAD protocols.},

Currently, no software exists that utilizes both paired-end reads from RADseq data to efficiently produce population-informative variant calls, especially for non-model organisms with large effective population sizes and high levels of genetic polymorphism. dDocent is an analysis pipeline with a user-friendly, command-line interface designed to process individually barcoded RADseq data (with double cut sites) into informative SNPs/Indels for population-level analyses. The pipeline, written in BASH, uses data reduction techniques and other stand-alone software packages to perform quality trimming and adapter removal, de novo assembly of RAD loci, read mapping, SNP and Indel calling, and baseline data filtering. Double-digest RAD data from population pairings of three different marine fishes were used to compare dDocent with Stacks, the first generally available, widely used pipeline for analysis of RADseq data. dDocent consistently identified more SNPs shared across greater numbers of individuals and with higher levels of coverage. This is due to the fact that dDocent quality trims instead of filtering, incorporates both forward and reverse reads (including reads with INDEL polymorphisms) in assembly, mapping, and SNP calling. The pipeline and a comprehensive user guide can be found at http://dDocent.wordpress.com.},

  Abstract                 = {We are writing in response to the population and phylogenomics meeting review by Andrews & Luikart (2014) entitled "Recent novel approaches for population genomics data analysis." Restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing has become a powerful and useful approach in molecular ecology, with several different published methods now available to molecular ecologists, none of which can be considered the best option in all situations. A&L report that the original RAD protocol of Miller et al. (2007) & Baird et al. (2008) is superior to all other RAD variants because putative PCR duplicates can be identified (see Baxter et al. 2011), thereby reducing the impact of PCR artifacts on allele frequency estimates (Andrews & Luikart 2014). In response, we (1) challenge the assertion that the original RAD protocol minimizes the impact of PCR artifacts relative to that of other RAD protocols, (2) present additional biases in RADseq that are at least as important as PCR artifacts in selecting a RAD protocol, and (3) highlight the strengths and weaknesses of four different approaches to RADseq which are a representative sample of all RAD variants: the original RAD protocol (mbRAD, Miller et al.2007, Baird et al.2008), double digest RAD (ddRAD, Peterson et al. 2012), ezRAD (Toonen et al.2013), and 2bRAD (Wang et al. 2012). With an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different RAD protocols, researchers can make a more informed decision when selecting a RAD protocol. This article is protected by copyright.

  Abstract                 = {Identification of genes involved in reproductive isolation opens novel ways to investigate links between stages of the speciation process. Are the genes coding for ecological adaptations and sexual isolation the same that eventually lead to hybrid sterility and inviability? We review the role of sex-linked genes at different stages of speciation based on four main differences between sex chromosomes and autosomes; (1) relative speed of evolution, (2) non-random accumulation of genes, (3) exposure of incompatible recessive genes in hybrids and (4) recombination rate. At early stages of population divergence ecological differences appear mainly determined by autosomal genes, but fast-evolving sex-linked genes are likely to play an important role for the evolution of sexual isolation by coding for traits with sex-specific fitness effects (for example, primary and secondary sexual traits). Empirical evidence supports this expectation but mainly in female-heterogametic taxa. By contrast, there is clear evidence for both strong X- and Z-linkage of hybrid sterility and inviability at later stages of speciation. Hence genes coding for sexual isolation traits are more likely to eventually cause hybrid sterility when they are sex-linked. We conclude that the link between sexual isolation and evolution of hybrid sterility is more intuitive in male-heterogametic taxa because recessive sexually antagonistic genes are expected to quickly accumulate on the X-chromosome. However, the broader range of sexual traits that are expected to accumulate on the Z-chromosome may facilitate adaptive speciation in female-heterogametic species by allowing male signals and female preferences to remain in linkage disequilibrium despite periods of gene flow.},

  Abstract                 = {Transcontinental migration is a fascinating example of how animals can respond to climatic oscillation. Yet, quantitative data on fitness components are scarce, and the resulting population genetic consequences are poorly understood. Migratory divides, hybrid zones with a transition in migratory behaviour, provide a natural setting to investigate the micro-evolutionary dynamics induced by migration under sympatric conditions. Here, we studied the effects of migratory programme on survival, trait evolution and genome-wide patterns of population differentiation in a migratory divide of European barn swallows. We sampled a total of 824 individuals from both allopatric European populations wintering in central and southern Africa, respectively, along with two mixed populations from within the migratory divide. While most morphological characters varied by latitude consistent with Bergmann's rule, wing length co-varied with distance to wintering grounds. Survival data collected during a 5-year period provided strong evidence that this covariance is repeatedly generated by disruptive selection against intermediate phenotypes. Yet, selection-induced divergence did not translate into genome-wide genetic differentiation as assessed by microsatellites, mtDNA and >20¬†000 genome-wide SNP markers; nor did we find evidence of local genomic selection between migratory types. Among breeding populations, a single outlier locus mapped to the BUB1 gene with a role in mitotic and meiotic organization. Overall, this study provides evidence for an adaptive response to variation in migration behaviour continuously eroded by gene flow under current conditions of nonassortative mating. It supports the theoretical prediction that population differentiation is difficult to achieve under conditions of gene flow despite measurable disruptive selection.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Homology detection is a long-standing challenge in computational biology. To tackle this problem, typically all-versus-all BLAST results are coupled with data partitioning approaches resulting in clusters of putative homologous proteins. One of the main problems, however, has been widely neglected: all clustering tools need a density parameter that adjusts the number and size of the clusters. This parameter is crucial but hard to estimate without gold standard data at hand. Developing a gold standard, however, is a difficult and time consuming task. Having a reliable method for detecting clusters of homologous proteins between a huge set of species would open opportunities for better understanding the genetic repertoire of bacteria with different lifestyles.Results: Our main contribution is a method for identifying a suitable and robust density parameter for protein homology detection without a given gold standard. Therefore, we study the core genome of 89 actinobacteria. This allows us to incorporate background knowledge, i.e. the assumption that a set of evolutionarily closely related species should share a comparably high number of evolutionarily conserved proteins (emerging from phylum-specific housekeeping genes). We apply our strategy to find genes/proteins that are specific for certain actinobacterial lifestyles, i.e. different types of pathogenicity. The whole study was performed with transitivity clustering, as it only requires a single intuitive density parameter and has been shown to be well applicable for the task of protein sequence clustering. Note, however, that the presented strategy generally does not depend on our clustering method but can easily be adapted to other clustering approaches.Availability: All results are publicly available at http://transclust.mmci.uni-saarland.de/actino_core/ or as Supplementary Material of this article.Contact: roettger@mpi-inf.mpg.deSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  Abstract                 = {The genomes of higher plants and animals are highly differentiated, and are composed of a relatively small number of genes and a large fraction of repetitive DNA. The bulk of this repetitive DNA constitutes transposable, and especially retrotransposable, elements. It has been hypothesized that most of these elements are heavily methylated relative to genes, but the evidence for this is controversial. We show here that repeat sequences in maize are largely excluded from genomic shotgun libraries by the selection of an appropriate host strain because of their sensitivity to bacterial restriction-modification systems. In contrast, unmethylated genic regions are preserved in these genetically filtered libraries if the insert size is less than the average size of genes. The representation of unique maize sequences not found in plant reference genomes is also greatly enriched. This demonstrates that repeats, and not genes, are the primary targets of methylation in maize. The use of restrictive libraries in genome shotgun sequencing in plant genomes should allow significant representation of genes, reducing the number of reactions required.},

  Abstract                 = {<title>Author Summary</title><p>Species richness varies by many orders of magnitude across the evolutionary "tree of life." Some groups, like beetles and flowering plants, contain nearly incomprehensible species diversity, but the overwhelming majority of groups contain far fewer species. Many processes presumably contribute to this variation in diversity, but the most general explanatory variable is the evolutionary age of each group: older groups will simply have had more time for diversity to accumulate than younger groups. We tested whether evolutionary age explains differences in species richness by compiling diversity and age estimates for nearly 1,400 groups of multicellular organisms. Surprisingly, we find no evidence that old groups have more species than young groups. This result appears to hold across the entire tree of life, for taxa as diverse as ferns, fungi, and flies. We demonstrate that this pattern is highly unlikely under simple but widely used evolutionary models that allow diversity to increase through time without bounds. Paleontologists have long contended that diversity-dependent processes have regulated species richness through time, and our results suggest that such processes have left a footprint on the living biota that can even be seen without data from the fossil record.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {Population demographic history may be learned from contemporary genetic variation data. Methods based on aggregating the statistics of many single loci into an allele frequency spectrum (AFS) have proven powerful, but such methods ignore potentially informative patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between neighboring loci. To leverage such patterns, we developed a composite-likelihood framework for inferring demographic history from aggregated statistics of pairs of loci. Using this framework, we show that two-locus statistics are indeed more sensitive to demographic history than single-locus statistics such as the AFS. In particular, two-locus statistics escape the notorious confounding of depth and duration of a bottleneck, and they provide a means to estimate effective population size based on the recombination rather than mutation rate. We applied our approach to a Zambian population of Drosophila melanogaster. Notably, using both single- and two-locus statistics, we found substantially lower estimates of effective population size than previous works. Together, our results demonstrate the broad potential for two-locus statistics to enable powerful population genetic inference.},

However, inferring population structure in large modern data sets imposes severe computational challenges. Here, we develop efficient algorithms for approximate inference of the model underlying the STRUCTURE program using a variational Bayesian framework. Variational methods pose the problem of computing relevant posterior distributions as an optimization problem, allowing us to build on recent advances in optimization theory to develop fast inference tools. In addition, we propose useful heuristic scores to identify the number of populations represented in a data set and a new hierarchical prior to detect weak population structure in the data. We test the variational algorithms on simulated data and illustrate using genotype data from the CEPH-Human Genome Diversity Panel. The variational algorithms are almost two orders of magnitude faster than STRUCTURE and achieve accuracies comparable to those of ADMIXTURE. Furthermore, our results show that the heuristic scores for choosing model complexity provide a reasonable range of values for the number of populations represented in the data, with minimal bias toward detecting structure when it is very weak.

  Abstract                 = {In the classic view introduced by R. A. Fisher, a quantitative trait is encoded by many loci with small, additive effects. Recent advances in quantitative trait loci mapping have begun to elucidate the genetic architectures underlying vast numbers of phenotypes across diverse taxa, producing observations that sometimes contrast with Fisher's blueprint. Despite these considerable empirical efforts to map the genetic determinants of traits, it remains poorly understood how the genetic architecture of a trait should evolve, or how it depends on the selection pressures on the trait. Here, we develop a simple, population-genetic model for the evolution of genetic architectures. Our model predicts that traits under moderate selection should be encoded by many loci with highly variable effects, whereas traits under either weak or strong selection should be encoded by relatively few loci. We compare these theoretical predictions with qualitative trends in the genetics of human traits, and with systematic data on the genetics of gene expression levels in yeast. Our analysis provides an evolutionary explanation for broad empirical patterns in the genetic basis for traits, and it introduces a single framework that unifies the diversity of observed genetic architectures, ranging from Mendelian to Fisherian.},

  Abstract                 = {Parallel speciation occurs when selection drives repeated, independent adaptive divergence that reduces gene flow between ecotypes. Classical examples show parallel speciation originating from shared genomic variation, but this does not seem to be the case in the rough periwinkle (Littorina saxatilis) that has evolved considerable phenotypic diversity across Europe, including several distinct ecotypes. Small 'wave' ecotype snails inhabit exposed rocks and experience strong wave action, while thick-shelled, 'crab' ecotype snails are larger and experience crab predation on less exposed shores. Crab and wave ecotypes appear to have arisen in parallel and recent evidence suggests only marginal sharing of molecular variation linked to evolution of similar ecotypes in different parts of Europe. However the extent of genomic sharing is expected to increase with gene flow and more recent common ancestry. To test this we used de novo RAD-sequencing to quantify the extent of shared genomic divergence associated with phenotypic similarities among ecotype-pairs on three close islands (< 10 km distance) connected by weak gene flow (Nm~0.03) and with recent common ancestry (< 10,000 years). After accounting for technical issues, including a large proportion of null alleles due to a large effective population size, we found ~8-28\% of positive outliers were shared between two islands and ~2-9\% were shared among all three islands. This low level of sharing suggests that parallel phenotypic divergence in this system is not matched by shared genomic divergence despite a high probability of gene flow and standing genetic variation.

  Abstract                 = {With rates of climate change exceeding the rate at which many species are able to shift their range or adapt, it is important to understand how future changes are likely to affect biodiversity at all levels of organisation. Understanding past responses and extent of niche conservatism in climatic tolerance can help predict future consequences. We use an integrated approach to determine the genetic consequences of past and future climate changes on a bat species, Plecotus austriacus. Glacial refugia predicted by palaeo-modelling match those identified from analyses of extant genetic diversity and model-based inference of demographic history. Former refugial populations currently contain disproportionately high genetic diversity, but niche conservatism, shifts in suitable areas and barriers to migration mean that these hotspots of genetic diversity are under threat from future climate change. Evidence of population decline despite recent northward migration highlights the need to conserve leading-edge populations for spearheading future range shifts.},

  Abstract                 = {Research in evolutionary biology involving nonmodel organisms is rapidly shifting from using traditional molecular markers such as mtDNA and microsatellites to higher throughput SNP genotyping methodologies to address questions in population genetics, phylogenetics and genetic mapping. Restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD sequencing or RADseq) has become an established method for SNP genotyping on Illumina sequencing platforms. Here, we developed a protocol and adapters for double-digest RAD sequencing for Ion Torrent (Life Technologies; Ion Proton, Ion PGM) semiconductor sequencing. We sequenced thirteen genomic libraries of three different nonmodel vertebrate species on Ion Proton with PI chips: Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus, European whitefish Coregonus lavaretus and common lizard Zootoca vivipara. This resulted in ~962¬†million single-end reads overall and a mean of ~74¬†million reads per library. We filtered the genomic data using Stacks, a bioinformatic tool to process RAD sequencing data. On average, we obtained ~11¬†000 polymorphic loci per library of 6‚Äì30 individuals. We validate our new method by technical and biological replication, by reconstructing phylogenetic relationships, and using a hybrid genetic cross to track genomic variants. Finally, we discuss the differences between using the different sequencing platforms in the context of RAD sequencing, assessing possible advantages and disadvantages. We show that our protocol can be used for Ion semiconductor sequencing platforms for the rapid and cost-effective generation of variable and reproducible genetic markers.},

  Abstract                 = {Male secondary sexual characters (conspicuous ornaments, signals, colors) are among nature's most striking features. Yet, it is unclear why certain groups of organisms are more likely than others to evolve these traits. One explanation for such taxonomic biases is that some genetic systems may be especially conducive to sexual selection. Here, we present theory and simulation results demonstrating that rare alleles encoding either male ornaments or female preferences for those ornaments are better protected against random loss in species with ZZZW or ZZZO sex chromosome systems (male homogamety) than in species with XXXY or XXXO systems (male heterogamety). Moreover, this protection is much stronger in diploid than haplodiploid species. We also present empirical data showing that male secondary sexual characters are better developed in diploid than haplodiploid species and in diploid species with male homogamety than in those with male heterogamety. Thus, taxonomic biases for showy males may stem from differences in sex chromosome systems.},

These ideas were tested in the grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus. ES ranged over four orders of magnitude, around a mean of 442,000 sperm. ES was independent of male body size and female fecundity. None of the male condition parameters - age, degree of parasitism, macropterism score (a measurement of competitive energy allocation to other sources), and the mass-femur length residuals - explained variation in ES. As expected in species where females are cyclically non-receptive after mating, male-male encounters before copulation were a more reliable indicator of the risk of sperm competition than the number of males present during copulation. In particular, the summative number of male-male encounters rather than the male-male encounter frequency was a significant predictor of ES variation (24.9%).},

It has been suggested that its laboratory measurement may frequently represent an overestimation of the natural situation because laboratory females have little opportunity to avoid matings. Here, numbers of sperm stored by field-collected females are investigated in order to address whether this method is suitable for estimating field mating frequencies. 2. Data on sperm numbers stored by females and their estimated age based on mandible abrasion were fitted to a simple mechanistic model to obtain estimates of: (i) remating interval; (ii) ejaculate size, and (iii) the rate of sperm loss from the female sperm store. Females were calculated to remate every 5.920137.0 days. By contrast, sperm numbers of field-collected females did not exceed ejaculate size, which would have resulted in the false conclusion that females mate only once. 3. In the laboratory, females first mated when aged 4201311 days and remated approximately every 2.6 days. Because females are not restricted by mate encounters under these conditions, this confirms the notion that female mating rates are likely to be lower in the field than in the laboratory. Such reduced field mating rates should be taken into account when predicting ecological or evolutionary parameters based on laboratory observed mating rates.},

To determine a special role of the sex chromosomes for sexually selected traits, I compared the estimated influence of X-chromosomal genes on sexually selected traits with their estimated influence on traits not under sexual selection. About one-third of the phenotypic variation in sexually selected traits is caused by X-chromosomal genes. There was, in contrast, no significant influence of X-chromosomal genes on traits that were classified as not sexually selected. Sexually selected traits thus seem to be influenced significantly more by X-chromosomal genes than traits not under sexual selection. Though this differential influence of X-chromosomal genes cannot readily be explained with current theoretical knowledge, it may. shed some light on X-linked hybrid sterility and on the discussion between arbitrary and good-gene models for the evolution of female choice. },

  Abstract                 = {Landscape genomics is an emerging research field that aims to identify the environmental factors that shape adaptive genetic variation and the gene variants that drive local adaptation. Its development has been facilitated by next-generation sequencing, which allows for screening thousands to millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms in many individuals and populations at reasonable costs. In parallel, data sets describing environmental factors have greatly improved and increasingly become publicly accessible. Accordingly, numerous analytical methods for environmental association studies have been developed. Environmental association analysis identifies genetic variants associated with particular environmental factors and has the potential to uncover adaptive patterns that are not discovered by traditional tests for the detection of outlier loci based on population genetic differentiation. We review methods for conducting environmental association analysis including categorical tests, logistic regressions, matrix correlations, general linear models and mixed effects models. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches, provide a list of dedicated software packages and their specific properties, and stress the importance of incorporating neutral genetic structure in the analysis. We also touch on additional important aspects such as sampling design, environmental data preparation, pooled and reduced-representation sequencing, candidate-gene approaches, linearity of allele-environment associations and the combination of environmental association analyses with traditional outlier detection tests. We conclude by summarizing expected future directions in the field, such as the extension of statistical approaches, environmental association analysis for ecological gene annotation, and the need for replication and post hoc validation studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Sequencing of pooled samples (Pool-Seq) using next-generation sequencing technologies has become increasingly popular, because it represents a rapid and cost-effective method to determine allele frequencies for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in population pools. Validation of allele frequencies determined by Pool-Seq has been attempted using an individual genotyping approach, but these studies tend to use samples from existing model organism databases or DNA stores, and do not validate a realistic setup for sampling natural populations. Here we used pyrosequencing to validate allele frequencies determined by Pool-Seq in three natural populations of Arabidopsis halleri (Brassicaceae). The allele frequency estimates of the pooled population samples (consisting of 20 individual plant DNA samples) were determined after mapping Illumina reads to (i) the publicly available, high-quality reference genome of a closely related species (Arabidopsis thaliana) and (ii) our own de novo draft genome assembly of A. halleri. We then pyrosequenced nine selected SNPs using the same individuals from each population, resulting in a total of 540 samples. Our results show a highly significant and accurate relationship between pooled and individually determined allele frequencies, irrespective of the reference genome used. Allele frequencies differed on average by less than 4\%. There was no tendency that either the Pool-Seq or the individual-based approach resulted in higher or lower estimates of allele frequencies. Moreover, the rather high coverage in the mapping to the two reference genomes, ranging from 55 to 284x, had no significant effect on the accuracy of the Pool-Seq. A resampling analysis showed that only very low coverage values (below 10-20x) would substantially reduce the precision of the method. We therefore conclude that a pooled re-sequencing approach is well suited for analyses of genetic variation in natural populations.},

  Abstract                 = {A distance measure for populations diverging by drift only is based on the coancestry coefficient theta, and three estimators of the distance D = -ln(1 - theta) are constructed for multiallelic, multilocus data. Simulations of a monoecious population mating at random showed that a weighted ratio of single-locus estimators performed better than an unweighted average or a least squares estimator. Jackknifing over loci provided satisfactory variance estimates of distance values. In the drift situation, in which mutation is excluded, the weighted estimator of D appears to be a better measure of distance than others that have appeared in the literature.},

Eleven potentially useful characters are re-evaluated in the male and six in the female.

In females the shape and length of the ventral valves of the ovipositor are found to be the most useful characters. The acoustic behaviour, cytology, serology, ecology and distribution of the two species are discussed.

These phenomena can be especially problematic for rare species coming into contact with more abundant ones. Increased use of molecular techniques focuses attention on the extent of this underappreciated problem that is not always apparent from morphological observations alone. Some degree of gene flow is a normal, evolutionarily constructive process, and all constellations of genes and genotypes cannot be preserved. However, hybridization with or without introgression may, nevertheless, threaten a rare species' existence. },

  Abstract                 = {A "satyr" is any male that successfully mates and reduces the reproductive success of a female of a different species or population. We sought to model the interaction of such potentially intermating species that are initially isolated in space but come to occupy overlapping niches. This model incorporates logistical growth curves, Lotka-Volterra interspecific competition, the satyr effect, and dispersal of the populations to neighboring demes. Both parapatry and extinction can occur in the presence of asymmetrical population parameters, depending on the dispersal characteristics of the interacting species. Parapatry is predicted at small migration constants, whereas extinction will occur at large ones. Species extinction may result from reproductive competition (satyrization) alone. Parapatry will be stable in relatively sessile organisms interacting through satyrs even in the absence of competition for common resources. The outcome of interactions between two species thus results from both trophic and reproductive competition.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolution involves both deterministic and random processes, both of which are known to contribute to directional evolutionary change. A number of studies have shown that when fitness is treated as a random variable, meaning that each individual has a distribution of possible fitness values, then both the mean and variance of individual fitness distributions contribute to directional evolution. Unfortunately the most general mathematical description of evolution that we have, the Price equation, is derived under the assumption that both fitness and offspring phenotype are fixed values that are known exactly. The Price equation is thus poorly equipped to study an important class of evolutionary processes.I present a general equation for directional evolutionary change that incorporates both deterministic and stochastic processes and applies to any evolving system. This is essentially a stochastic version of the Price equation, but it is derived independently and contains terms with no analog in Price's formulation. This equation shows that the effects of selection are actually amplified by random variation in fitness. It also generalizes the known tendency of populations to be pulled towards phenotypes with minimum variance in fitness, and shows that this is matched by a tendency to be pulled towards phenotypes with maximum positive asymmetry in fitness. This equation also contains a term, having no analog in the Price equation, that captures cases in which the fitness of parents has a direct effect on the phenotype of their offspring.Directional evolution is influenced by the entire distribution of individual fitness, not just the mean and variance. Though all moments of individuals' fitness distributions contribute to evolutionary change, the ways that they do so follow some general rules. These rules are invisible to the Price equation because it describes evolution retrospectively. An equally general prospective evolution equation compliments the Price equation and shows that the influence of stochastic processes on directional evolution is more diverse than has generally been recognized.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies on the classic shell colour and banding polymorphism of the land snail Cepaea played a crucial role in establishing the importance of natural selection in maintaining morphological variation. Cepaea is also a pre-eminent model for ecological genetics because the outward colour and banding phenotype is entirely genetically determined, primarily by a 'supergene' of at least five loci. Unfortunately, progress in understanding the evolution and maintenance of the Cepaea polymorphism stalled, partly because of a lack of genetic markers. With a view to re-establish Cepaea as a prominent model of molecular ecology, we made six laboratory crosses of Cepaea nemoralis, five of which segregated for shell ground colour (C) and the presence or absence of bands (B). First, scoring of colour and banding in 323 individuals found no recombination between the C and B loci of the supergene. Second, using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) of two parents and 22 offspring, we identified 44 anonymous markers putatively linked to the colour (C) and banding (B) loci. The genotype of eleven of the most promising RAD-Seq markers was independently validated in the same 22 offspring, then up to a further 146 offspring were genotyped. The closest RAD-Seq markers scored are within ~0.6 centimorgan (cM) of the C-B supergene linkage group, with the combined loci together forming a 35.8 cM linkage map of markers that flank both sides of the Cepaea C-B supergene.},

This model divides the F(st)-influencing factors into locus-specific effects, population-specific effects, and effects that are specific for the locus in combination with the population. We introduce a Bayesian auxiliary variable for each locus effect to automatically select nonneutral locus effects. As a by-product, the efficiency of the original approach is improved by using a reparameterization of the model. The statistical power of the extended algorithm is assessed with simulated data sets from a Wright-Fisher model with migration. We find that the inclusion of model selection suggests a clear improvement in discrimination as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Additionally, we illustrate and discuss the quality of the newly developed method on the basis of an allozyme data set of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and a sequence data set of the wild tomato Solanum chilense. For data sets with small sample sizes, high mutation rates, and/or long sequences, however, methods based on nucleotide statistics should be preferred.},

  Abstract                 = {The production of extreme or 'transgressive' phenotypes in segregating hybrid populations has been speculated to contribute to niche divergence of hybrid lineages. Here, we assess the frequency of transgressive segregation in hybrid populations, describe its genetic basis and discuss the factors that best predict its occurrence. From a survey of 171 studies that report phenotypic variation in segregating hybrid populations, we show that transgression is the rule rather than the exception. In fact, 155 of the 171 studies (91\%) report at least one transgressive trait, and 44\% of 1229 traits examined were transgressive. Transgression occurred most frequently in intraspecific crosses involving inbred, domesticated plant populations, and least frequently in interspecific crosses between outbred, wild animal species. Quantitative genetic studies of plant hybrids consistently point to the action of complementary genes as the primary cause of transgression, although overdominance and epistasis also contribute. Complementary genes appear to be common for most traits, with the possible exception of those with a history of disruptive selection. These results lend credence to the view that hybridization may provide the raw material for rapid adaptation and provide a simple explanation for niche divergence and phenotypic novelty often associated with hybrid lineages.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic analyses of reproductive barriers represent one of the few methods by which theories of speciation can be tested. However, genetic study is often restricted to model organisms that have short generation times and are easily propagated in the laboratory. Replicate hybrid zones with a diversity of recombinant genotypes of varying age offer increased resolution for genetic mapping experiments and expand the pool of organisms amenable to genetic study. Using 88 markers distributed across 17 chromosomes, we analyze the introgression of chromosomal segments of Helianthus petiolaris into H. annuus in three natural hybrid zones. Introgression was significantly reduced relative to neutral expectations for 26 chromosomal segments, suggesting that each segment contains one or more factors that contribute to isolation. Pollen sterility is significantly associated with 16 of these 26 segments, providing a straightforward explanation of why this subset of blocks is disadvantageous in hybrids. In addition, comparison of rates of introgression across colinear vs. rearranged chromosomes indicates that close to 50\% of the barrier to introgression is due to chromosomal rearrangements. These results demonstrate the utility of hybrid zones for identifying factors contributing to isolation and verify the prediction of increased resolution relative to controlled crosses.},

  Abstract                 = {Target enrichment, also referred to as DNA capture, provides an effective way to focus sequencing efforts on a genomic region of interest. Capture data are typically used to detect single-nucleotide variants. It can also be used to detect copy number alterations, which is particularly useful in the context of cancer, where such changes occur frequently. In copy number analysis, it is a common practice to determine log-ratios between test and control samples, but this approach results in a loss of information as it disregards the total coverage or intensity at a locus.We modeled the coverage or intensity of the test sample as a linear function of the control sample. This regression approach is able to deal with regions that are completely deleted, which are problematic for methods that use log-ratios. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we used capture data to determine copy number for a set of 600 genes in a panel of nine breast cancer cell lines. We found high concordance between our results and those generated using a single-nucleotide polymorphsim genotyping platform. When we compared our results with other log-ratio-based methods, including ExomeCNV, we found that our approach produced better overall correlation with SNP data.The algorithm is implemented in C and R and the code can be downloaded from http://bioinformatics.nki.nl/ocs/l.wessels@nki.nlSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

However, analyzing high-throughput sequencing data remains challenging, particularly in clinical settings where accuracy and turnaround times are critical. We present a new approach to this problem, implemented in a software package called Platypus. Platypus achieves high sensitivity and specificity for SNPs, indels and complex polymorphisms by using local de novo assembly to generate candidate variants, followed by local realignment and probabilistic haplotype estimation. It is an order of magnitude faster than existing tools and generates calls from raw aligned read data without preprocessing. We demonstrate the performance of Platypus in clinically relevant experimental designs by comparing with SAMtools and GATK on whole-genome and exome-capture data, by identifying de novo variation in 15 parent-offspring trios with high sensitivity and specificity, and by estimating human leukocyte antigen genotypes directly from variant calls.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Sexual selection has a reputation as a major cause of speciation, one of the most potent forces driving reproductive isolation. This reputation arises from observations that species differ most in traits involved with mating success and from successful models of sexual selectionâdriven speciation. But how well proven is the case? Models confirm that the process can occur, but is strongest in conjunction with ecological or niche specialization. Some models also show that strong sexual selection can act against speciation. Studies using the comparative method are equivocal and often inconclusive, but some phylogeographic studies are more convincing. Experimental evolution and genetic or genomic analyses are in their infancy, but look particularly promising for resolving the importance of sexual selection. The case for sexual selection is not as strongly supported as, for example, allopatric speciation. Sexual selection probably contributes most effectively alongside ecological selection or selection for species recognition than as a solitary process.},

Here, female preference functions have been characterized for the tettigoniid bushcricket Ephippiger ephippiger, and the inheritance of male song and female preference functions followed in crosses between subspecies. Songs are disproportionately determined by sex-linked genes. However, there is no evidence for a role of maternally derived sex-linked genes in female preference or of maternal effects. At the genetic level, there is a mismatch between peak preferences and male song, consistent with an evolutionary history of persistent directional preferences. Such a pattern of inheritance could contribute to the process of speciation via the evolution of new MRSs.},

This study examines the behavior of hybrid Ephippiger ephippiger bushcrickets, the third major orthopteran group.

However, in the present study, C. p. erythropus females continued to mate assortatively, and readily, with males that had been made dumb by the removal of their wings. Furthermore, this assortment broke down, and matings occurred less readily, following the removal of the antennae of both sexes. With C. p. parallelus the converse applied, i.e. assortment continued after the antennae were removed and mating occurred less readily in the absence of song. This implies that a substantial degree of differentiation (a change in the main channel of communication) has occurred between the mate recognition systems of these subspecies without leading to speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {Two subspecies of the grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus meet and form a hybrid zone in the Pyrenees. Both strong hybrid dysfunction and a behavioural difference occur, which would seem to make the zone a suitable candidate for speciation by reinforcement. One of the classic ways of looking for this is to test for increased levels of assortative mating between populations from close to the region of contact. Here we show that, with virgin insects, such assortment decreases as one approaches the centre of the zone in C. parallelus. The pattern is different upon remating, with non-virgins showing a pattern more like that predicted by reinforcement. Overall there is little evidence for reinforcement. We argue that other tests of the model may be more appropriate for stable hybrid zones.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has the goal of providing decision makers with an indication of the likely environmental consequences of planned actions risking environmental changes and, when necessary, allowing revision of these actions to mitigate adverse impacts. Here we provide an overview of the efficiency of \{EIA\} with emphasis on Brazilian Amazonia and discuss the problems and challenges with this type of assessment in highly diverse ecosystems. We concentrate on the methodology and performance of \{EIAs\} for three of the most recent and largest infrastructure projects in Amazonia: the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam, the BR-319 Highway, and the Juruti bauxite mine. We conclude that all of these \{EIAs\} fall short of properly assessing the expected impact of infrastructure development in situ, and that their results had little or no effect on policy decisions. To improve the reliability and usefulness of \{EIAs\} in biologically diverse ecosystems, we suggest three relatively fast and cost-effective complementary approaches for assessing biodiversity: remote sensing, reflectance spectroscopy, and \{DNA\} meta-barcoding. We discuss how these emerging cutting-edge techniques can help in identifying environmental threats and the consequences of different activities in Amazonia. The ability to monitor the state of the environment and the likely impacts of human activities on natural resources is fundamental to evidence-based decisions on development choices, to the design of appropriate management strategies, and to mitigate biological and ecological consequences. },

  Abstract                 = {During autumn 'swarming', large numbers of temperate bats chase each other in and around underground sites. Swarming has been proposed to be a mating event, allowing interbreeding between bats from otherwise isolated summer colonies. We studied the population structure of the Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri), a swarming species in northern England, by sampling bats at seven sites in two swarming areas and at 11 summer colonies. Analysis of molecular variance (amova) and genetic assignment analyses showed that the swarming areas (60 km apart) support significantly different populations. A negative correlation was found between the distance of a summer colony from a swarming area and the assignment of bats to that area. High gene diversity was found at all sites (HE = 0.79) suggesting high gene flow. This was supported by a low FST (0.017) among summer colonies and the absence of isolation by distance or substructure among colonies which visit one swarming area. The FST, although low, was significantly different from zero, which could be explained by a combination of female philopatry and male-mediated gene flow through mating at swarming sites with bats from other colonies. Modelling suggested that if effective size of the summer colonies (Ne) was low to moderate (10-30), all mating must occur at the swarming sites to account for the observed FST. If the Ne was higher (50), in addition to random mating during swarming, there may be nonrandom mating at swarming sites or some within-colony mating. Conservation of swarming sites that support potentially large populations is discussed.},

Inferential tools for historical demography given these data sets are, at present, underdeveloped. In particular, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has yet to be widely embraced by researchers generating these data. Here, we demonstrate the promise of ABC for analysis of the large data sets that are now attainable from nonmodel taxa through current genomic sequencing technologies. We develop and test an ABC framework for model selection and parameter estimation, given histories of three-population divergence with admixture. We then explore different sampling regimes to illustrate how sampling more loci, longer loci or more individuals affects the quality of model selection and parameter estimation in this ABC framework. Our results show that inferences improved substantially with increases in the number and/or length of sequenced loci, while less benefit was gained by sampling large numbers of individuals. Optimal sampling strategies given our inferential models included at least 2000 loci, each approximately 2 kb in length, sampled from five diploid individuals per population, although specific strategies are model and question dependent. We tested our ABC approach through simulation-based cross-validations and illustrate its application using previously analysed data from the oak gall wasp, Biorhiza pallida.},

  Abstract                 = {The allele frequency spectrum (AFS) consists of counts of the number of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci with derived variants present at each given frequency in a sample. Multiple approaches have recently been developed for parameter estimation and calculation of model likelihoods based on the joint AFS from two or more populations. We conducted a simulation study of one of these approaches, implemented in the Python module δaδi, to compare parameter estimation and model selection accuracy given different sample sizes under one- and two-population models.Our simulations included a variety of demographic models and two parameterizations that differed in the timing of events (divergence or size change). Using a number of SNPs reasonably obtained through next-generation sequencing approaches (10,000 - 50,000), accurate parameter estimates and model selection were possible for models with more ancient demographic events, even given relatively small numbers of sampled individuals. However, for recent events, larger numbers of individuals were required to achieve accuracy and precision in parameter estimates similar to that seen for models with older divergence or population size changes. We quantify i) the uncertainty in model selection, using tools from information theory, and ii) the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates, using the root mean squared error, as a function of the timing of demographic events, sample sizes used in the analysis, and complexity of the simulated models.Here, we illustrate the utility of the genome-wide AFS for estimating demographic history and provide recommendations to guide sampling in population genomics studies that seek to draw inference from the AFS. Our results indicate that larger samples of individuals (and thus larger AFS) provide greater power for model selection and parameter estimation for more recent demographic events.},

  Abstract                 = {The search for the alleles that matter, the quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) that underlie heritable variation within populations and divergence among them, is a popular pursuit. But what is the question to which QTNs are the answer? Although their pursuit is often invoked as a means of addressing the molecular basis of phenotypic evolution or of estimating the roles of evolutionary forces, the QTNs that are accessible to experimentalists, QTNs of relatively large effect, may be uninformative about these issues if large-effect variants are unrepresentative of the alleles that matter. Although 20th century evolutionary biology generally viewed large-effect variants as atypical, the field has recently undergone a quiet realignment toward a view of readily discoverable large-effect alleles as the primary molecular substrates for evolution. I argue that neither theory nor data justify this realignment. Models and experimental findings covering broad swaths of evolutionary phenomena suggest that evolution often acts via large numbers of small-effect polygenes, individually undetectable. Moreover, these small-effect variants are different in kind, at the molecular level, from the large-effect alleles accessible to experimentalists. Although discoverable QTNs address some fundamental evolutionary questions, they are essentially misleading about many others.},

  Abstract                 = {To help understand the elusive mechanisms of zebrafish sex determination, we studied the genetic machinery regulating production and breakdown of retinoic acid (RA) during the onset of meiosis in gonadogenesis. Results uncovered unexpected mechanistic differences between zebrafish and mammals. Conserved synteny and expression analyses revealed that cyp26a1 in zebrafish and its paralog Cyp26b1 in tetrapods independently became the primary genes encoding enzymes available for gonadal RA-degradation, showing lineage-specific subfunctionalization of vertebrate genome duplication (VGD) paralogs. Experiments showed that zebrafish express aldh1a2, which encodes an RA-synthesizing enzyme, in the gonad rather than in the mesonephros as in mouse. Germ cells in bipotential gonads of all zebrafish analyzed were labeled by the early meiotic marker sycp3, suggesting that in zebrafish, the onset of meiosis is not sexually dimorphic as it is in mouse and is independent of Stra8, which is required in mouse but was lost in teleosts. Analysis of dead-end knockdown zebrafish depleted of germ cells revealed the germ cell-independent onset and maintenance of gonadal aldh1a2 and cyp26a1 expression. After meiosis initiated, somatic cell expression of cyp26a1 became sexually dimorphic: up-regulated in testes but not ovaries. Meiotic germ cells expressing the synaptonemal complex gene sycp3 occupied islands of somatic cells that lacked cyp26a1 expression, as predicted by the hypothesis that Cyp26a1 acts as a meiosis-inhibiting factor. Consistent with this hypothesis, females up-regulated cyp26a1 in oocytes that entered prophase-I meiotic arrest, and down-regulated cyp26a1 in oocytes resuming meiosis. Co-expression of cyp26a1 and the pluripotent germ cell stem cell marker pou5f1(oct4) in meiotically arrested oocytes was consistent with roles in mouse to promote germ cell survival and to prevent apoptosis, mechanisms that are central for tipping the sexual fate of gonads towards the female pathway in zebrafish.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary diversification is often initiated by adaptive divergence between populations occupying ecologically distinct environments while still exchanging genes. The genetic foundations of this divergence process are largely unknown and are here explored through genome scans in multiple independent lake-stream population pairs of threespine stickleback. We find that across the pairs, overall genomic divergence is associated with the magnitude of divergence in phenotypes known to be under divergent selection. Along this same axis of increasing diversification, genomic divergence becomes increasingly biased towards the centre of chromosomes as opposed to the peripheries. We explain this pattern by within-chromosome variation in the physical extent of hitchhiking, as recombination is greatly reduced in chromosome centres. Correcting for this effect suggests that a great number of genes distributed widely across the genome are involved in the divergence into lake vs. stream habitats. Analyzing additional allopatric population pairs, however, reveals that strong divergence in some genomic regions has been driven by selection unrelated to lake-stream ecology. Our study highlights a major contribution of large-scale variation in recombination rate to generating heterogeneous genomic divergence and indicates that elucidating the genetic basis of adaptive divergence might be more challenging than currently recognized.},

The reason is that these 'uninformative' polymorphisms lack the adequate potential to capture signatures of drift and hitchhiking, the focal processes in ecological genome scans. Bias associated with uninformative polymorphisms is not eliminated by just avoiding technical artifacts in the data (PCR and sequencing errors), as a high proportion of SNPs with a low minor allele frequency is a general biological feature of natural populations.We suggest that uninformative markers should be excluded from genome scans based on empirical criteria derived from careful inspection of the data, and that these criteria should be reported explicitly. Together, this should increase the quality and comparability of genome scans, and hence promote our understanding of the processes driving genomic differentiation.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative genetics is at or is fast approaching its centennial. In this perspective I consider five current issues pertinent to the application of quantitative genetics to evolutionary theory. First, I discuss the utility of a quantitative genetic perspective in describing genetic variation at two very different levels of resolution, (1) in natural, free-ranging populations and (2) to describe variation at the level of DNA transcription. Whereas quantitative genetics can serve as a very useful descriptor of genetic variation, its greater usefulness is in predicting evolutionary change, particularly when used in the first instance (wild populations). Second, I review the contributions of Quantitative trait loci (QLT) analysis in determining the number of loci and distribution of their genetic effects, the possible importance of identifying specific genes, and the ability of the multivariate breeder's equation to predict the results of bivariate selection experiments. QLT analyses appear to indicate that genetic effects are skewed, that at least 20 loci are generally involved, with an unknown number of alleles, and that a few loci have major effects. However, epistatic effects are common, which means that such loci might not have population-wide major effects: this question waits upon (QTL) analyses conducted on more than a few inbred lines. Third, I examine the importance of research into the action of specific genes on traits. Although great progress has been made in identifying specific genes contributing to trait variation, the high level of gene interactions underlying quantitative traits makes it unlikely that in the near future we will have mechanistic models for such traits, or that these would have greater predictive power than quantitative genetic models. In the fourth section I present evidence that the results of bivariate selection experiments when selection is antagonistic to the genetic covariance are frequently not well predicted by the multivariate breeder's equation. Bivariate experiments that combine both selection and functional analyses are urgently needed. Finally, I discuss the importance of gaining more insight, both theoretical and empirical, on the evolution of the G and P matrices.},

  Abstract                 = {Adaptive evolutionary change is contingent on variation and selection; thus, understanding adaptive divergence and ultimately speciation requires information on both the genetic basis of adaptive traits as well as an understanding of the role of divergent natural selection on those traits. The lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) consists of several sympatric "dwarf" (limnetic) and normal (benthic) species pairs that co-inhabit northern postglacial lakes. These young species pairs have evolved independently and display parallelism in life history, behavioral, and morphological divergence associated with the use of distinct trophic resources. We identified phenotype-environment associations and determined the genetic architecture and the role of selection modulating population genetic divergence in sympatric dwarf and normal lake whitefish. The genetic architecture of 9 adaptive traits was analyzed in 2 hybrid backcrosses individually phenotyped throughout their life history. Significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) were associated with swimming behavior (habitat selection and predator avoidance), growth rate, morphology (condition factor and gill rakers), and life history (onset of maturity and fecundity). Genome scans among 4 natural sympatric pairs, using loci segregating in the map, revealed a signature of selection for 24 loci. Loci exhibiting a signature of selection were associated with QTL relative to other regions of the genome more often than expected by chance alone. Two parallel QTL outliers for growth and condition factor exhibited segregation distortion in both mapping families, supporting the hypothesis that adaptive divergence contributing to parallel reductions of gene flow among natural populations may cause genetic incompatibilities. Overall, these findings offer evidence that the genetic architecture of ecological speciation is associated with signatures of selection in nature, providing strong support for the hypothesis that divergent natural selection is currently maintaining adaptive differentiation and promoting ecological speciation in lake whitefish species pairs.},

We integrated adaptive QTL mapping and genomic scans among diverging sympatric pairs of the lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) species complex in order to test the hypothesis that differentiation between dwarf and normal ecotypes at growth-associated QTL was maintained by directional selection.

If they affect many traits (are pleiotropic), large effect mutations should contribute more when a population evolves to a farther adaptive peak than to a nearer peak. We tested this prediction in wild threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) by comparing the estimated frequency of large effect genetic changes underlying evolution as the same ancestor adapted to two lake types since the end of the ice age. A higher frequency of large effect genetic changes (quantitative trait loci) contributed to adaptive evolution in populations that adapted to lakes representing a more distant optimum than to lakes in which the optimum phenotype was nearer to the ancestral state. Our results also indicate that pleiotropy, not just optimum overshoot, contributes to this difference. These results suggest that a series of adaptive improvements to a new environment leaves a detectable mark in the genome of wild populations. Although not all assumptions of the theory are likely met in natural systems, the prediction may be robust enough to the complexities of natural environments to be useful when forecasting adaptive responses to large environmental changes.},

 Background
 VSEARCH is an open source and free of charge multithreaded 64-bit tool for processing and preparing metagenomics, genomics and population genomics nucleotide sequence data. It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use.
 
 
 Methods
 When searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using vectorisation and multiple threads.
 
 
 Results
 VSEARCH includes most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH version 8, including searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or \textit{de novo}), dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with several new commands and improvements, including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging. VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication. VSEARCH is available at https://github.com/torognes/vsearch under either the BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License version 3.0.
 
 
 Discussion
 VSEARCH has been shown to be a fast, accurate and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH. A free and open-source versatile tool for sequence analysis is now available to the metagenomics community.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Understanding the factors that shape adaptive genetic variation across species niches has become of paramount importance in evolutionary ecology, especially to understand how adaptation to changing climate affects the geographic range of species. The distribution of adaptive alleles in the ecological niche is determined by the emergence of novel mutations, their fitness consequences and gene flow that connects populations across species niches. Striking demographical differences and source‚Äîsink dynamics of populations between the centre and the margin of the niche can play a major role in the emergence and spread of adaptive alleles. Although some theoretical predictions have long been proposed, the origin and distribution of adaptive alleles within species niches remain untested. In this paper, we propose and discuss a novel empirical approach that combines landscape genetics with species niche modelling, to test whether alleles that confer local adaptation are more likely to occur in either marginal or central populations of species niches. We illustrate this new approach by using a published data set of 21 alpine plant species genotyped with a total of 2483 amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP), distributed over more than 1733 sampling sites across the Alps. Based on the assumption that alleles that were statistically associated with environmental variables were adaptive, we found that adaptive alleles in the margin of a species niche were also present in the niche centre, which suggests that adaptation originates in the niche centre. These findings corroborate models of species range evolution, in which the centre of the niche contributes to the emergence of novel adaptive alleles, which diffuse towards niche margins and facilitate niche and range expansion through subsequent local adaptation. Although these results need to be confirmed via fitness measurements in natural populations and functionally characterised genetic sequences, this study provides a first step towards understanding how adaptive genetic variation emerges and shapes species niches and geographic ranges along environmental gradients. },

In reality, there is often considerable uncertainty about both the tree and the character mapping. Recently introduced Bayesian statistical methods enable the study of character evolution while simultaneously accounting for both phylogenetic and mapping uncertainty, adding much needed credibility to the reconstruction of evolutionary history.},

With large next-generation sequencing data sets we are now able to ask whether introgression has occurred across the genome, and multiple methods have been proposed to detect the signature of such events. Here, we introduce a new summary statistic that can be used to test for introgression, RNDmin, that makes use of the minimum pairwise sequence distance between two population samples relative to divergence to an outgroup. We find that our method offers a modest increase in power over other, related tests, but that all such tests have high power to detect introgressed loci when migration is recent and strong. RNDmin is robust to variation in the mutation rate, and remains reliable even when estimates of the divergence time between sister species are inaccurate. We apply RNDmin to population genomic data from the African mosquitoes Anopheles quadriannulatus and A.¬†arabiensis, identifying three novel candidate regions for introgression. Interestingly, one of the introgressed loci is on the X chromosome, but outside of an inversion separating these two species. Our results suggest that significant, but rare, sharing of alleles is occurring between species that diverged more than 1 million years ago, and that application of these methods to additional systems are likely to reveal similar results.},

We examined 10 years of parentage data in a colony of greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) to determine the magnitude of male reproductive skew and the opportunity for sexual selection in a mammal in which females are the larger sex. Annual paternity success was weakly skewed but consistent patterns led to strong longitudinal paternity skew among breeders. Just three males accounted for a third of all paternity assignments, representing at least a fifth of all colony offspring born in a decade. Paternity success was in part determined by age but was not influenced by dispersal status. Our results show that paternity skew and the opportunity for sexual selection in a species with reversed sexual size dimorphism can approach levels reported for classical examples of species with polygyny and male-biased dimorphism, even where the traits under sexual selection are not known.},

  Abstract                 = {Population divergence can be detected by the divergence of functional and neutral characters. Under some circumstances, it is desirable to have available a character that is discretely expressed in either of the diverging genomes, rather than the evaluation of qualitative variation of continuous characters. In the present study, we investigated mass peaks of peptide hormones in a model system of population divergence, the hybrid zone of two Chorthippus parallelus subspecies in the French2013Spanish Pyrenees. Mass spectra from neuroendocrine tissues have previously been identified as species-specific and may have a sufficient resolution to vary at the subspecies level. For the first time, we succeeded in the detection of a subspecies-specific expression of neuropeptides collected from single individuals. Mass spectra sampled from populations across the C. parallelus grasshopper hybrid zone indicated neuropeptide identity between the sexes and within sample sites. The distribution of a single distinct but variable peptide signal, however, very closely followed the cline of the hybrid zone as derived from the mean variation in several continuous characters. The identity of this peptide in populations from the northern Pyrenees and central Europe supports a neuropeptide differentiation of preglacial origin. The observed differentiation in the peptide profile of the two subspecies demonstrates that a peptidomic approach may be a promising perspective to reconstruct reproductive isolation in an insect hybrid zone.  © 2007 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2007, 91, 5412013548.},

  Abstract                 = {Drosophila montana, a species of the Drosophila virilis group, has distributed around the northern hemisphere. Phylogeographic analyses of two North American and one Eurasian population of this species offer a good background for the studies on the extent of variation in phenotypic traits between populations as well as for tracing the selection pressures likely to play a role in character divergence. In the present paper, we studied variation in the male courtship song, wing and genital characters among flies from Colorado (USA), Vancouver (Canada) and Oulanka (Finland) populations. The phenotypic divergence among populations did not coincide with the extent of their genetic divergence, suggesting that the characters are not evolving neutrally. Divergence in phenotypic traits was especially high between the Colorado and Vancouver populations, which are closer to each other in terms of their mtDNA genotypes than they are to the Oulanka population. The males of the Colorado population showed high divergence especially in song traits and the males of the Vancouver population in wing characters. Among the male song traits, two characters known to be under sexual selection and a trait important in species recognition differed clearly between populations, implying a history of directional and/or diversifying rather than balancing selection. The population divergence in wing characters is likely to have been enhanced by natural selection associated with environmental factors, whereas the male genitalia traits may have been influenced by sexual selection and/or sexual conflict.},

  Abstract                 = {The first North American RAD Sequencing and Genomics Symposium, sponsored by Floragenex (http://www.floragenex.com/radmeeting/), took place in Portland, Oregon (USA) on 19 April 2011. This symposium was convened to promote and discuss the use of restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing technologies. RAD sequencing is one of several strategies recently developed to increase the power of data generated via short-read sequencing technologies by reducing their complexity (Baird etÂ al. 2008; Huang etÂ al. 2009; Andolfatto etÂ al. 2011; Elshire etÂ al. 2011). RAD sequencing, as a form of genotyping by sequencing, has been effectively applied in genetic mapping and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses in a range of organisms including nonmodel, genetically highly heterogeneous organisms (TableÂ 1; Baird etÂ al. 2008; Baxter etÂ al. 2011; Chutimanitsakun etÂ al. 2011; Pfender etÂ al. 2011). RAD sequencing has recently found applications in phylogeography (Emerson etÂ al. 2010) and population genomics (Hohenlohe etÂ al. 2010). Considering the diversity of talks presented during this meeting, more developments are to be expected in the very near future.1 âPublished studies using RAD sequencing Organism by applicationReferencesGenetic mappingÂ Three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)Baird etÂ al.

Here, in an exploratory study, we construct a spatially explicit model of population movement to examine the consequences of secondary contact of populations singing distinct songs. We concentrate on two broad questions: 1) will population specific songs be maintained in a contact zone or will they be replaced by shared song, and 2) what spatial patterns in the distribution of songs may result from contact? We examine the effects of multiple factors including song-based mating preferences and movement probabilities, oblique versus paternal learning of song, and both cultural and genetic mutations. We find a variety of conditions under which population specific songs can be maintained, particularly when females have preferences for their population specific songs, and we document many distinct patterns of song distribution within the contact zone, including clines, banding, and mosaics.},

For populations of frog Rana esculenta and laboratory mouse lines C57B1 and CBA the analysis was made with cells of different tissues: erythrocytes for R. esculenta, splenocytes for mice and haploid cells of testes for both species. The results of DNA cytometry, obtained with cells of different species, were shown to be correlated, which indicates the objectivity of individual intrapopulation differences in the genome size recorded with DNA flow cytometry. The level of variability (expressed as CV) was 0.3-0.4\% for the population of frogs, and 0.2-0.3\% for mouse lines. The analysis of genome size variability in cell populations of different animal species revealed a relationship between the variability level and the genome size: the coefficient of variance of the peak of DNA histogram was inversely related to the square root of genome size. The latter effect may be explained by fluctuations of a measured multicomponent object, but it is still unclear whether these fluctuations could be related to the genome size or to pecularities of chromatin structure. It is concluded that the method of flow DNA cytometry may be effective for studying individual differences in the genome size.},

  Abstract                 = {Hybridization and introgression are believed to play important roles in plant evolution. However, few empirical studies have been designed to clarify the ways in which these processes complicate taxonomic delimitation. Recent phylogenetic studies based on a number of different DNA fragments have indicated that Picea brachytyla in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is polyphyletic, a finding that contrasts with traditional taxonomy based on morphological traits. We aimed to test this conflict using transcriptomic data from 26 trees collected from multiple localities for this and related species. Our phylogenomic analyses suggest that the sampled trees of P.¬†brachytyla cluster into two distinct lineages corresponding to the two taxonomically recognized intraspecific varieties: var. brachytyla and var. complanata. However, var. complanata nested within Picea likiangensis and was sister to one of its three varieties, while var. brachytyla comprised an isolated lineage. The polyphyletic origin hypothesis was further supported by likelihood tree comparisons using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and by coalescent analyses under the snapp model. However, our abba-baba and ‚àÇa‚àÇi analyses suggest that gene flow between these two independently evolved lineages has been extensive and bidirectional. Introgression, as well as parallel evolution in the arid habitats common to both lineages, may have given rise to their morphological similarity. Our study highlights the importance of genomic evidence and the use of newly developed coalescent analysis methods for clarifying the evolutionary complexity of certain plant taxa.},

  Abstract                 = {Reduced-representation genome sequencing represents a new source of data for systematics, and its potential utility in interspecific phylogeny reconstruction has not yet been explored. One approach that seems especially promising is the use of inexpensive short-read technologies (e.g., Illumina, SOLiD) to sequence restriction-site associated DNA (RAD)--the regions of the genome that flank the recognition sites of restriction enzymes. In this study, we simulated the collection of RAD sequences from sequenced genomes of different taxa (Drosophila, mammals, and yeasts) and developed a proof-of-concept workflow to test whether informative data could be extracted and used to accurately reconstruct "known" phylogenies of species within each group. The workflow consists of three basic steps: first, sequences are clustered by similarity to estimate orthology; second, clusters are filtered by taxonomic coverage; and third, they are aligned and concatenated for "total evidence" phylogenetic analysis. We evaluated the performance of clustering and filtering parameters by comparing the resulting topologies with well-supported reference trees and we were able to identify conditions under which the reference tree was inferred with high support. For Drosophila, whole genome alignments allowed us to directly evaluate which parameters most consistently recovered orthologous sequences. For the parameter ranges explored, we recovered the best results at the low ends of sequence similarity and taxonomic representation of loci; these generated the largest supermatrices with the highest proportion of missing data. Applications of the method to mammals and yeasts were less successful, which we suggest may be due partly to their much deeper evolutionary divergence times compared to Drosophila (crown ages of approximately 100 and 300 versus 60 Mya, respectively). \textbf{RAD sequences thus appear to hold promise for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships in younger clades in which sufficient numbers of orthologous restriction sites are retained across species.}},

  Abstract                 = {The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques presents many novel opportunities for many applications in life sciences. The vast number of short reads produced by these techniques, however, pose significant computational challenges. The first step in many types of genomic analysis is the mapping of short reads to a reference genome, and several groups have developed dedicated algorithms and software packages to perform this function. As the developers of these packages optimize their algorithms with respect to various considerations, the relative merits of different software packages remain unclear. However, for scientists who generate and use NGS data for their specific research projects, an important consideration is choosing the software that is most suitable for their application.With a view to comparing existing short read alignment software, we develop a simulation and evaluation suite, Seal, which simulates NGS runs for different configurations of various factors, including sequencing error, indels and coverage. We also develop criteria to compare the performances of software with disparate output structure (e.g. some packages return a single alignment while some return multiple possible alignments). Using these criteria, we comprehensively evaluate the performances of Bowtie, BWA, mr- and mrsFAST, Novoalign, SHRiMP and SOAPv2, with regard to accuracy and runtime.We expect that the results presented here will be useful to investigators in choosing the alignment software that is most suitable for their specific research aims. Our results also provide insights into the factors that should be considered to use alignment results effectively. Seal can also be used to evaluate the performance of algorithms that use deep sequencing data for various purposes (e.g. identification of genomic variants).Seal is available as open source at http://compbio.case.edu/seal/.matthew.ruffalo@case.eduSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite dramatic growth in the field of primate genomics over the past decade, studies of primate population and conservation genomics in the wild have been hampered due to the difficulties inherent in studying non-model organisms and endangered species, such as lack of a reference genome and current challenges in de novo primate genome assembly. Here, we used Restriction-site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to develop a population-based SNP panel for the Ugandan red colobus (P. rufomitratus tephrosceles), which is a highly threatened monkey due to habitat loss. We analyzed blood samples from 24 individuals from Kibale National Park (Uganda) using single-end RAD sequencing. We obtained 70,773,857 reads, of which 58,814,906 passed the filtering steps. Using the program STACKS v. 1.11 we identified 113,376 loci, of which 50,558 were polymorphic and had a mean observed heterozygosity of 0.25. These data will be used to study the effects of habitat fragmentation on genomic diversity, dispersal, and disease transmission in this species. Our approach provides a good example of the potential of RAD sequencing in studies of wild primate populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Stress responses play an important role in shaping species distributions and robustness to climate change. We investigated how stress responses alter the contribution of additive genetic variation to gene expression during development of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, under increased temperatures that model realistic climate change scenarios. We first measured gene expression responses in the embryos by RNA-seq to characterize molecular signatures of mild, chronic temperature stress in an unbiased manner. We found that an increase from 12 to 18 Â°C caused widespread alterations in gene expression including in genes involved in protein folding, RNA processing and development. To understand the quantitative genetic architecture of this response, we then focused on a well-characterized gene network involved in endomesoderm and ectoderm specification. Using a breeding design with wild-caught individuals, we measured genetic and geneâenvironment interaction effects on 72 genes within this network. We found genetic or maternal effects in 33 of these genes and that the genetic effects were correlated in the network. Fourteen network genes also responded to higher temperatures, but we found no significant genotypeâenvironment interactions in any of the genes. This absence may be owing to an effective buffering of the temperature perturbations within the network. In support of this hypothesis, perturbations to regulatory genes did not affect the expression of the genes that they regulate. Together, these results provide novel insights into the relationship between environmental change and developmental evolution and suggest that climate change may not expose large amounts of cryptic genetic variation to selection in this species.},

  Abstract                 = {Mating preferences are common in natural populations, and their divergence among populations is considered an important source of reproductive isolation during speciation. Although mechanisms for the divergence of mating preferences have received substantial theoretical treatment, complementary experimental tests are lacking. We conducted a laboratory evolution experiment, using the fruit fly Drosophila serrata, to explore the role of divergent selection between environments in the evolution of female mating preferences. Replicate populations of D. serrata were derived from a common ancestor and propagated in one of three resource environments: two novel environments and the ancestral laboratory environment. Adaptation to both novel environments involved changes in cuticular hydrocarbons, traits that predict mating success in these populations. Furthermore, female mating preferences for these cuticular hydrocarbons also diverged among populations. A component of this divergence occurred among treatment environments, accounting for at least 17.4\% of the among-population divergence in linear mating preferences and 17.2\% of the among-population divergence in nonlinear mating preferences. The divergence of mating preferences in correlation with environment is consistent with the classic by-product model of speciation in which premating isolation evolves as a side effect of divergent selection adapting populations to their different environments.},

  Abstract                 = {Genomic selection, a breeding method that promises to accelerate rates of genetic gain, requires dense, genome-wide marker data. Genotyping-by-sequencing can generate a large number of de novo markers. However, without a reference genome, these markers are unordered and typically have a large proportion of missing data. Because marker imputation algorithms were developed for species with a reference genome, algorithms suited for unordered markers have not been rigorously evaluated. Using four empirical datasets, we evaluate and characterize four such imputation methods, referred to as k-nearest neighbors, singular value decomposition, random forest regression, and expectation maximization imputation, in terms of their imputation accuracies and the factors affecting accuracy. The effect of imputation method on the genomic selection accuracy is assessed in comparison with mean imputation. The effect of excluding markers with a large proportion of missing data on the genomic selection accuracy is also examined. Our results show that imputation of unordered markers can be accurate, especially when linkage disequilibrium between markers is high and genotyped individuals are related. Of the methods evaluated, random forest regression imputation produced superior accuracy. In comparison with mean imputation, all four imputation methods we evaluated led to greater genomic selection accuracies when the level of missing data was high. Including rather than excluding markers with a large proportion of missing data nearly always led to greater GS accuracies. We conclude that high levels of missing data in dense marker sets is not a major obstacle for genomic selection, even when marker order is not known.},

In this study, the mathematics of quantitative PCR are examined in detail, from which several fundamental aspects of the threshold method and the application of standard curves are illustrated. The construction of five replicate standard curves for two pairs of nested primers was used to examine the reproducibility and degree of quantitative variation using SYBER Green I fluorescence. Based upon this analysis the application of a single, well- constructed standard curve could provide an estimated precision of +/-6-21\%, depending on the number of cycles required to reach threshold. A simplified method for absolute quantification is also proposed, in which quantitative scale is determined by DNA mass at threshold.},

  Abstract                 = {In the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, DNA is amplified in vitro by a series of polymerization cycles consisting of three temperature-dependent steps: DNA denaturation, primer-template annealing, and DNA synthesis by a thermostable DNA polymerase. The purity and yield of the reaction products depend on several parameters, one of which is the annealing temperature (Ta). At both sub- and super-optimal Ta values, non-specific products may be formed, and the yield of products is reduced. Optimizing the Ta is especially critical when long products are synthesized or when total genomic DNA is the substrate for PCR. In this article we experimentally determine the optimal annealing temperature (TaOPT) values for several primer-template pairs and develop a method for its calculation. The TaOPT is found to be a function of the melting temperatures of the less stable primer-template pair and of the product. The fact that experimental and calculated TaOPT values agree to within 0.7 degree C eliminates the need for determining TaOPT experimentally. Synthesis of DNA fragments shorter than 1 kb is more efficient if a variable Ta is used, such that the Ta is higher in each consecutive cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {Birds have for long been popular study objects in speciation research. Being easy to observe in the field, they have traditionally been particularly important in studies of behavioural and ecological factors in speciation, whereas the genetic aspects of the process have been studied in other organisms, such as Drosophila. More recently, however, a stronger genetic focus has been placed on speciation research also in birds. Here, we review ecological, behavioural and genetic studies on speciation in the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) and the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). These well-studied birds provide among the few proposed examples of the process of reinforcement of premating isolation, and the evidence for reinforcement is strong. They are further characterized by having strong intrinsic postzygotic barriers (female hybrid sterility), yet the two species appear to be very similar ecologically. This is in stark contrast to another well-studied bird complex, Darwin's finches, in which the species differ vastly in ecologically important traits but have no developmental problems arising from genetic incompatibilities, and where no evidence for reinforcement is found. In the flycatchers, sex chromosome linkage of genes affecting traits associated with both pre- and postzygotic barriers to gene exchange is likely to facilitate reinforcement. We discuss whether such sex-linkage may be common in birds. The contrast between flycatchers and Darwin's finches indicate that speciation in birds cannot always be understood mainly as a result of divergent natural selection ('ecological speciation'), and generalizations from one system may lead us astray. We discuss to what extent insight from research on the flycatchers may point to fruitful avenues for future research on bird speciation and specifically call for a more systematic effort to simultaneously investigate ecology, behaviour and genetics of birds caught in the process of speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Species recognition and intraspecific mating preferences constitute two basic aspects of animal communication. Both can be considered as variations in response to signals and it has been suggested that they represent a continuum. Selection on species recognition could therefore influence intraspecific mating preferences. We show that females of the common European grasshopper Chorthippus biguttulus prefer conspecific male signals that can be distinguished more reliably from sympatrically occurring heterospecific signals. This suggests that in C. biguttulus, sexual selection might be influenced by pleiotropic effects from species recognition. The results show how the heterospecific signal environment could have determined why and in which direction specific traits become sexually selected.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge of the genetic basis of divergence in mating signal characters that contribute to reproductive isolation is critical to understanding speciation. Here, we describe a semi-automated system for characterizing grasshopper acoustic signals. We used this system to study the genetic basis of divergence in three male calling song components [echeme (EL), syllable (SL) and phrase (PL) lengths] between Chorthippus brunneus and C. jacobsi, two species of grasshoppers that hybridize in northern Spain. We also studied the number of pegs in the stridulatory file. For all characters, additive effects accounted for most of the genetic differentiation between species. However, the three song components also showed small but significant epistatic effects. No sex linkage was detected. Wright-Castle-Lande estimates of the minimum numbers of genetic factors underlying song and peg number divergence were low: peg number (n(e)=5.87+/-5.84), SL (n(e)=2.37+/-4.79) and PL (n(e)=0.87+/-0.86). On the other hand, EL appeared to be controlled by many genes. These results suggest that divergence in SL and PL might be driven by sexual selection whereas EL might not be under selection. This is consistent with experimental results on female song preference in related species. However, the fact that few factors appear to underlie the differences in peg number is surprising. Peg number is not closely related to song characteristics. It often varies between closely related grasshopper species and it has been assumed to be a neutral character. The biometrical approaches used here tend to underestimate the number of factors influencing a trait but provide valuable background for subsequent quantitative trait loci analyses.},

Thus, identifying the target sequences methylated by dDNMT2 may constitute the first step towards understanding the biological functions of this enzyme. We used anti-5-methylcytosine antibodies as affinity column to identify the methylated sequences in the genome of adult flies. Our analysis demonstrates that components of retrotransposons and repetitive DNA sequences are putative substrates for dDNMT2. The methylation status of DNA encoding Gag, a protein involved in delivering the transposition template to its DNA target, was confirmed by sodium bisulfite sequencing.},

  Abstract                 = {New sequencing technology has dramatically altered the landscape of whole-genome sequencing, allowing scientists to initiate numerous projects to decode the genomes of previously unsequenced organisms. The lowest-cost technology can generate deep coverage of most species, including mammals, in just a few days. The sequence data generated by one of these projects consist of millions or billions of short DNA sequences (reads) that range from 50 to 150 nt in length. These sequences must then be assembled de novo before most genome analyses can begin. Unfortunately, genome assembly remains a very difficult problem, made more difficult by shorter reads and unreliable long-range linking information. In this study, we evaluated several of the leading de novo assembly algorithms on four different short-read data sets, all generated by Illumina sequencers. Our results describe the relative performance of the different assemblers as well as other significant differences in assembly difficulty that appear to be inherent in the genomes themselves. Three overarching conclusions are apparent: first, that data quality, rather than the assembler itself, has a dramatic effect on the quality of an assembled genome; second, that the degree of contiguity of an assembly varies enormously among different assemblers and different genomes; and third, that the correctness of an assembly also varies widely and is not well correlated with statistics on contiguity. To enable others to replicate our results, all of our data and methods are freely available, as are all assemblers used in this study.},

Neolamprologus marunguensis contains mtDNA haplotypes from both parental species varying on average by 12.4\% in the first section of the control region and by 5.2\% in a segment of the cytochrome b gene. All individuals have almost identical DNA sequences in the flanking regions of the single-copy nuclear DNA locus TmoM27, and show a mosaic of alleles derived from both parental lineages in six microsatellite loci. Hence, our finding displays another mode of speciation in cichlid fishes. The increase of genetic and phenotypic diversity due to hybridization may contribute to the uniquely rapid pace of speciation in cichlids.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The exceptionally diverse species flocks of cichlid fishes in East Africa are prime examples of parallel adaptive radiations. About 80\% of East Africa's more than 1 800 endemic cichlid species, and all species of the flocks of Lakes Victoria and Malawi, belong to a particularly rapidly evolving lineage, the haplochromines. One characteristic feature of the haplochromines is their possession of egg-dummies on the males' anal fins. These egg-spots mimic real eggs and play an important role in the mating system of these maternal mouthbrooding fish. RESULTS: Here, we show that the egg-spots of haplochromines are made up of yellow pigment cells, xanthophores, and that a gene coding for a type III receptor tyrosine kinase, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor a (csf1ra), is expressed in egg-spot tissue. Molecular evolutionary analyses reveal that the extracellular ligand-binding and receptor-interacting domain of csf1ra underwent adaptive sequence evolution in the ancestral lineage of the haplochromines, coinciding with the emergence of egg-dummies. We also find that csf1ra is expressed in the egg-dummies of a distantly related cichlid species, the ectodine cichlid Ophthalmotilapia ventralis, in which markings with similar functions evolved on the pelvic fin in convergence to those of the haplochromines. CONCLUSION: We conclude that modifications of existing signal transduction mechanisms might have evolved in the haplochromine lineage in association with the origination of anal fin egg-dummies. That positive selection has acted during the evolution of a color gene that seems to be involved in the morphogenesis of a sexually selected trait, the egg-dummies, highlights the importance of further investigations of the comparative genomic basis of the phenotypic diversification of cichlid fishes.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The adaptive radiations of cichlid fishes in East Africa are well known for their spectacular diversity and their astonishingly fast rates of speciation. About 80\% of all 2,500 cichlid species in East Africa, and virtually all cichlid species from Lakes Victoria (approximately 500 species) and Malawi (approximately 1,000 species) are haplochromines. Here, we present the most extensive phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis so far that includes about 100 species and is based on about 2,000 bp of the mitochondrial DNA. RESULTS: Our analyses revealed that all haplochromine lineages are ultimately derived from Lake Tanganyika endemics. We find that the three most ancestral lineages of the haplochromines sensu lato are relatively species poor, albeit widely distributed in Africa, whereas a fourth newly defined lineage - the 'modern haplochromines' - contains an unparalleled diversity that makes up more than 7\% of the worlds' approximately 25,000 teleost species. The modern haplochromines' ancestor, most likely a riverine generalist, repeatedly gave rise to similar ecomorphs now found in several of the species flocks. Also, the Tanganyikan Tropheini are derived from that riverine ancestor suggesting that they successfully re-colonized Lake Tanganyika and speciated in parallel to an already established cichlid adaptive radiation. In contrast to most other known examples of adaptive radiations, these generalist ancestors were derived from highly diverse and specialized endemics from Lake Tanganyika. A reconstruction of life-history traits revealed that in an ancestral lineage leading to the modern haplochromines the characteristic egg-spots on anal fins of male individuals evolved. CONCLUSION: We conclude that Lake Tanganyika is the geographic and genetic cradle of all haplochromine lineages. In the ancestors of the replicate adaptive radiations of the 'modern haplochromines', behavioral (maternal mouthbrooding), morphological (egg-spots) and sexually selected (color polymorphism) key-innovations arose. These might be - together with the ecological opportunity that the habitat diversity of the large lakes provides - responsible for their evolutionary success and their propensity for explosive speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {With more than 3,000 species, the fish family Cichlidae is one of the most species-rich families of vertebrates. Cichlids occur in southern and central America, Africa, Madagascar, and India. The hotspot of their biodiversity is East Africa, where they form adaptive radiations composed of hundreds of endemic species in several lakes of various sizes and ages. The unparalleled species richness of East African cichlids has been something of a conundrum for evolutionary biologists and ecologists, since it has been in doubt whether these hundreds of species arose by allopatric speciation or whether it is necessary to invoke somewhat less traditional models of speciation, such as micro-allopatric, peripatric, or even sympatric speciation or evolution through sexual selection mediated by female choice. Ernst Mayr's analyses of these evolutionary uniquely diverse species assemblages have contributed to a more direct approach to this problem and have led to a deeper understanding of the patterns and processes that caused the formation of these huge groups of species. We review here recent molecular data on population differentiation and phylogenetics, which have helped to unravel, to some extent, the patterns and processes that led to the formation and ecological maintenance of cichlid species flocks. It is becoming apparent that sexually selected traits do play an important role in speciation in micro-allopatric or even sympatric settings. Species richness seems to be roughly correlated with the surface area, but not the age, of the lakes. We observe that the oldest lineages of a species flock of cichlids are often less species-rich and live in the open water or deepwater habitats. While the species flocks of the Lake Malawai and the Lake Victoria areas were shown to be monophyletic, the cichlid assemblage of Lake Tanganyika seems to consist of several independent species flocks. Cichlids emerge as an evolutionary model system in which many fundamental questions in evolution and ecology can be tested successfully, yet for other fish species flocks the relative importance of alternative mechanisms of speciation is likely to differ from that in cichlid fish.},

  Abstract                 = {Lake Tanganyika, the oldest of the East African Great Lakes, harbors the ecologically, morphologically, and behaviorally most complex of all assemblages of cichlid fishes, consisting of about 200 described species. The evolutionary old age of the cichlid assemblage, its extreme degree of morphological differentiation, the lack of species with intermediate morphologies, and the rapidity of lineage formation have made evolutionary reconstruction difficult. The number and origin of seeding lineages, particularly the possible contribution of riverine haplochromine cichlids to endemic lacustrine lineages, remains unclear. Our phylogenetic analyses, based on mitochondrial DNA sequences of three gene segments of 49 species (25\% of all described species, up to 2,400 bp each), yield robust phylogenies that provide new insights into the Lake Tanganyika adaptive radiation as well as into the origin of the Central- and East-African haplochromine faunas. Our data suggest that eight ancient African lineages may have seeded the Tanganyikan cichlid radiation. One of these seeding lineages, probably comprising substrate spawning Lamprologus-like species, diversified into six lineages that evolved mouthbrooding during the initial stage of the radiation. All analyzed haplochromines from surrounding rivers and lakes seem to have evolved within the radiating Tanganyikan lineages. Thus, our findings contradict the current hypothesis that ancestral riverine haplochromines colonized Lake Tanganyika to give rise to at least part of its spectacular endemic cichlid species assemblage. Instead, the early phases of the Tanganyikan radiation affected Central and East African rivers and lakes. The haplochromines may have evolved in the Tanganyikan basin before the lake became a hydrologically and ecologically closed system and then secondarily colonized surrounding rivers. Apparently, therefore, the current diversity of Central and East African haplochromines represents a relatively young and polyphyletic fauna that evolved from or in parallel to lineages now endemic to Lake Tanganyika.},

  Abstract                 = {The species flocks of cichlid fishes in the East African Lakes Tanganyika, Malawi and Victoria are prime examples of adaptive radiation and explosive speciation. Several hundreds of endemic species have evolved in each of the lakes over the past several thousands to a few millions years. Sexual selection via colour-assortative mating has often been proposed as a probable causal factor for initiating and maintaining reproductive isolation. Here, we report the consequences of human-mediated admixis among differentially coloured populations of the endemic cichlid fish Tropheus moorii from several localities that have accidentally been put in sympatry in a small harbour bay in the very south of Lake Tanganyika. We analysed the phenotypes (coloration) and genotypes (mitochondrial control region and five microsatellite loci) of almost 500 individuals, sampled over 3 consecutive years. Maximum-likelihood-based parenthood analyses and Bayesian inference of population structure revealed that significantly more juveniles are the product of within-colour-morph matings than could be expected under the assumption of random mating. Our results clearly indicate a marked degree of assortative mating with respect to the different colour morphs. Therefore, we postulate that sexual selection based on social interactions and female mate choice has played an important role in the formation and maintenance of the different colour morphs in Tropheus, and is probably common in other maternally mouthbrooding cichlids as well.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The cichlid fishes in general, and the exceptionally diverse East African haplochromine cichlids in particular, are famous examples of adaptive radiation and explosive speciation. Here we report the collection and annotation of more than 12,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated from three different cDNA libraries obtained from the East African haplochromine cichlid species Astatotilapia burtoni and Metriaclima zebra. RESULTS: We first annotated more than 12,000 newly generated cichlid ESTs using the Gene Ontology classification system. For evolutionary analyses, we combined these ESTs with all available sequence data for haplochromine cichlids, which resulted in a total of more than 45,000 ESTs. The ESTs represent a broad range of molecular functions and biological processes. We compared the haplochromine ESTs to sequence data from those available for other fish model systems such as pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis), trout, and zebrafish. We characterized genes that show a faster or slower rate of base substitutions in haplochromine cichlids compared to other fish species, as this is indicative of a relaxed or reinforced selection regime. Four of these genes showed the signature of positive selection as revealed by calculating Ka/Ks ratios. CONCLUSION: About 22\% of the surveyed ESTs were found to have cichlid specific rate differences suggesting that these genes might play a role in lineage specific characteristics of cichlids. We also conclude that the four genes with a Ka/Ks ratio greater than one appear as good candidate genes for further work on the genetic basis of evolutionary success of haplochromine cichlid fishes.},

GeneMCL transforms microarray analysis data into a graph consisting of nodes connected by edges, where the nodes represent genes, and the edges represent the similarity in expression of those genes, as given by a proximity measurement. This measurement is taken to be the Pearson correlation coefficient combined with a local non-linear rescaling step. The resulting graph is input to the Markov Cluster (MCL) algorithm, which is an elegant, deterministic, non-specific and scalable method, which models stochastic flow through the graph. The algorithm is inherently affected by any cluster structure present, and rapidly decomposes a graph into cohesive clusters. The potential of the GeneMCL algorithm is demonstrated with a 5,730 gene subset (IGS) of the Van't Veer breast cancer database, for which the clusterings are shown to reflect underlying biological mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the surprising insights gained from research in evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) is that increasing diversity in body plans and morphology in organisms across animal phyla are not reflected in similarly dramatic changes at the level of gene composition of their genomes. For instance, simplicity at the tissue level of organization often contrasts with a high degree of genetic complexity. Also intriguing is the observation that the coding regions of several genes of invertebrates show high sequence similarity to those in humans. This lack of change (conservation) indicates that evolutionary novelties may arise more frequently through combinatorial processes, such as changes in gene regulation and the recruitment of novel genes into existing regulatory gene networks (co-option), and less often through adaptive evolutionary processes in the coding portions of a gene. As a consequence, it is of great interest to examine whether the widespread conservation of the genetic machinery implies the same developmental function in a last common ancestor, or whether homologous genes acquired new developmental roles in structures of independent phylogenetic origin. To distinguish between these two possibilities one must refer to current concepts of phylogeny reconstruction and carefully investigate homology relationships. Particularly problematic in terms of homology decisions is the use of gene expression patterns of a given structure. In the future, research on more organisms other than the typical model systems will be required since these can provide insights that are not easily obtained from comparisons among only a few distantly related model species.},

  Abstract                 = {Q(ST) measures the differentiation of quantitative traits between populations. It is often compared to F(ST), which measures population differentiation at neutral marker loci due to drift, migration, and mutation. When Q(ST) is different from F(ST), it is usually taken as evidence that selection has either restrained or accelerated the differentiation of the quantitative trait relative to neutral markers. However, a number of other factors such as inbreeding, dominance, and epistasis may also affect the Q(ST) - F(ST) contrast. In this study, we examine the effects of dominance, selection, and inbreeding on Q(ST) - F(ST). We compare Q(ST) with F(ST) at selected and neutral loci for populations at equilibrium between selection, drift, mutation, and migration using both analytic and simulation approaches. Interestingly, when divergent selection is acting on a locus, inbreeding and dominance generally inflate Q(ST) relative to F(ST) when they are both measured at the quantitative locus at equilibrium. As a consequence, dominance is unlikely to hide the signature of divergent selection on the Q(ST) - F(ST) contrast. However, although in theory dominance and inbreeding affect the expectation for Q(ST) - F(ST), of most concern is the very large variance in both Q(ST) and F(ST), suggesting that we should be cautious in attributing small differences between Q(ST) and F(ST) to selection.},

  Abstract                 = {We constantly navigate around our environment. This means moving from our current location, place A, to a new goal, place B. We have recently learned much about spatial maps in the brain in which place cells indicate current location. However, it is unclear how navigational goals are represented in the brain. Sarel et al. describe a group of neurons in the brains of bats that are tuned to goal direction and distance relative to the bat{\textquoteright}s current position as it flies toward its goal. The finding elucidates the computations involved in spatial navigation.Science, this issue p. 176To navigate, animals need to represent not only their own position and orientation, but also the location of their goal. Neural representations of an animal{\textquoteright}s own position and orientation have been extensively studied. However, it is unknown how navigational goals are encoded in the brain. We recorded from hippocampal CA1 neurons of bats flying in complex trajectories toward a spatial goal. We discovered a subpopulation of neurons with angular tuning to the goal direction. Many of these neurons were tuned to an occluded goal, suggesting that goal-direction representation is memory-based. We also found cells that encoded the distance to the goal, often in conjunction with goal direction. The goal-direction and goal-distance signals make up a vectorial representation of spatial goals, suggesting a previously unrecognized neuronal mechanism for goal-directed navigation.},

  Abstract                 = {Frequencies of mutant sites are modeled as a Poisson random field in two species that share a sufficiently recent common ancestor. The selective effect of the new alleles can be favorable, neutral, or detrimental. The model is applied to the sample configurations of nucleotides in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh) in Drosophila simulans and Drosophila yakuba. Assuming a synonymous mutation rate of 1.5 x 10(-8) per site per year and 10 generations per year, we obtain estimates for the effective population size (N(e) = 6.5 x 10(6)), the species divergence time (tdiv = 3.74 million years), and an average selection coefficient (sigma = 1.53 x 10(-6) per generation for advantageous or mildly detrimental replacements), although it is conceivable that only two of the amino acid replacements were selected and the rest neutral. The analysis, which includes a sampling theory for the independent infinite sites model with selection, also suggests the estimate that the number of amino acids in the enzyme that are susceptible to favorable mutation is in the range 2-23 at any one time. The approach provides a theoretical basis for the use of a 2 x 2 contingency table to compare fixed differences and polymorphic sites with silent sites and amino acid replacements.},

Efforts to explain TE abundance, as well as TE diversity among genomes, have led some researchers to draw an analogy between genomic and ecological processes. Adopting this perspective, we conducted an analysis of the cow (Bos taurus) genome using techniques developed by community ecologists to determine whether environmental factors influence community composition. Specifically, each chromosome within the Bos taurus genome was treated as a "linear transect", and a multivariate redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to identify large-scale spatial patterns in TE communities associated with 10 TE families. The position of each TE community on the chromosome accounted for ∼50\% of the variation along the chromosome "transect". Multivariate analysis further revealed an effect of gene density on TE communities that is influenced by several other factors in the (genomic) environment, including chromosome length and TE density. The results of this analysis demonstrate that ecological methods can be applied successfully to help answer genomic questions.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:The globe artichoke (Cynara cardunculus L. var. scolymus) genome is relatively poorly explored, especially compared to those of the other major Asteraceae crops sunflower and lettuce. No SNP markers are in the public domain. We have combined the recently developed restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) approach with the Illumina DNA sequencing platform to effect the rapid and mass discovery of SNP markers for C. cardunculus.RESULTS:RAD tags were sequenced from the genomic DNA of three C. cardunculus mapping population parents, generating 9.7 million reads, corresponding to ~1Gbp of sequence. An assembly based on paired ends produced ~6.0Mbp of genomic sequence, separated into ~19,000 contigs (mean length 312bp), of which ~21% were fragments of putative coding sequence. The shared sequences allowed for the discovery of ~34,000 SNPs and nearly 800 indels, equivalent to a SNP frequency of 5.6 per 1,000nt, and an indel frequency of 0.2 per 1,000nt. A sample of heterozygous SNP loci was mapped by CAPS assays and this exercise provided validation of our mining criteria. The repetitive fraction of the genome had a high representation of retrotransposon sequence, followed by simple repeats, AT-low complexity regions and mobile DNA elements. The genomic k-mers distribution and CpG rate of C. cardunculus, compared with data derived from three whole genome-sequenced dicots species, provided a further evidence of the random representation of the C. cardunculus genome generated by RAD sampling.CONCLUSION:The RAD tag sequencing approach is a cost-effective and rapid method to develop SNP markers in a highly heterozygous species. Our approach permitted to generate a large and robust SNP datasets by the adoption of optimized filtering criteria.},

Here we present the assembly and analysis of a genome sequence for the western lowland gorilla, and compare the whole genomes of all extant great ape genera. We propose a synthesis of genetic and fossil evidence consistent with placing the human-chimpanzee and human-chimpanzee-gorilla speciation events at approximately 6 and 10 million years ago. In 30\% of the genome, gorilla is closer to human or chimpanzee than the latter are to each other; this is rarer around coding genes, indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution, and has functional consequences in gene expression. A comparison of protein coding genes reveals approximately 500 genes showing accelerated evolution on each of the gorilla, human and chimpanzee lineages, and evidence for parallel acceleration, particularly of genes involved in hearing. We also compare the western and eastern gorilla species, estimating an average sequence divergence time 1.75 million years ago, but with evidence for more recent genetic exchange and a population bottleneck in the eastern species. The use of the genome sequence in these and future analyses will promote a deeper understanding of great ape biology and evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Copy number variation (CNV) contributes significantly to natural genetic variation within and between populations. However, the mutational mechanisms leading to CNV, as well as the processes that control the size of CNV regions, are so far not well understood. Here, we have analyzed a gene family that forms CNV regions on the X and the Y chromosomes in Mus musculus. These CNV regions show copy number differences in two subspecies, M. musculus domesticus and M. musculus musculus. Assessment of copy numbers at these loci for individuals caught in a natural hybrid zone showed copy number increases and a large variance among individuals. Crosses of natural hybrid animals among each other produced even more extreme variants with major differences in copy number in the offspring from the same parents. To assess the inheritance pattern of the loci further, we have produced F1 and backcross hybrid animals from these subspecies. We found that copy number expansions can already be traced in F1 offspring and they became stronger in the backcross individuals. Specific analysis of hybrid male offspring indicated that neither meiotic recombination nor interchromosomal exchange was required for creating these changes because the X and Y chromosomes have no homologues in males. This suggests that intrachromosomal exchanges can drive CNV and that this can occur at an elevated frequency in interspecific crosses, even within an individual. Accordingly, we find copy number mosaicism in individuals, that is, DNA from different tissues of the same individual can have different copy numbers for the loci studied. A preliminary survey of autosomal loci suggests that these can also be subject to change in hybrids. Hence, we conclude that the effects we see are not only restricted to some specific loci but may also be caused by a general induction of replication-coupled repair processes.},

Thanks to the development of new statistical approaches for detecting and quantifying admixture from genomic data, genomes from extinct populations have proven useful both in revealing previously unknown hybridization events and informing the study of hybridization between living organisms. Here, we review some of the key recent statistical innovations for detecting ancient hybridization using genomewide sequence data and discuss how these innovations have revised our understanding of human evolutionary history.},

  Abstract                 = {A key step toward the discovery of a gene related to a trait is the finding of an association between the trait and one or more haplotypes. Haplotype analyses can also provide critical information regarding the function of a gene; however, when unrelated subjects are sampled, haplotypes are often ambiguous because of unknown linkage phase of the measured sites along a chromosome. A popular method of accounting for this ambiguity in case-control studies uses a likelihood that depends on haplotype frequencies, so that the haplotype frequencies can be compared between the cases and controls; however, this traditional method is limited to a binary trait (case vs. control), and it does not provide a method of testing the statistical significance of specific haplotypes. To address these limitations, we developed new methods of testing the statistical association between haplotypes and a wide variety of traits, including binary, ordinal, and quantitative traits. Our methods allow adjustment for nongenetic covariates, which may be critical when analyzing genetically complex traits. Furthermore, our methods provide several different global tests for association, as well as haplotype-specific tests, which give a meaningful advantage in attempts to understand the roles of many different haplotypes. The statistics can be computed rapidly, making it feasible to evaluate the associations between many haplotypes and a trait. To illustrate the use of our new methods, they are applied to a study of the association of haplotypes (composed of genes from the human-leukocyte-antigen complex) with humoral immune response to measles vaccination. Limited simulations are also presented to demonstrate the validity of our methods, as well as to provide guidelines on how our methods could be used.},

Integrating genome assembly with extensive genetic maps identified an unexpected evolutionary stability of chromosomes in fish, in contrast to in mammals. Genes associated with viviparity show signatures of positive selection, identifying new putative functional domains and rare cases of parallel evolution.

Sequence read lengths, initially very short, have rapidly increased since the technology first appeared, and we now are seeing a growing number of efforts to sequence large genomes de novo from these short reads. In this Perspective, we describe the issues associated with short-read assembly, the different types of data produced by second-gen sequencers, and the latest assembly algorithms designed for these data. We also review the genomes that have been assembled recently from short reads and make recommendations for sequencing strategies that will yield a high-quality assembly.},

Nature is usually assumed to respond to gradual change in a smooth way. However, studies on lakes, coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches to a contrasting state. Although diverse events can trigger such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state. This suggests that strategies for sustainable management of such ecosystems should focus on maintaining resilience.},

Here, I introduce a new multilocus test statistic, ln RV, which is based on the ratio of observed variances in repeat number at a set of microsatellite loci in two groups of populations. The distribution of ln RV values captures demographic history of the populations as well as variation in microsatellite mutation among loci. Given that microsatellite loci associated with a recent selective sweep differ from the remainder of the genome, they are expected to fall outside of the distribution of neutral ln RV values. The ln RV test statistic is applied to a data set of 94 loci typed in eight non-African and two African human populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Natural selection commonly drives the origin of species, as Darwin initially claimed. Mechanisms of speciation by selection fall into two broad categories: ecological and mutation-order. Under ecological speciation, divergence is driven by divergent natural selection between environments, whereas under mutation-order speciation, divergence occurs when different mutations arise and are fixed in separate populations adapting to similar selection pressures. Tests of parallel evolution of reproductive isolation, trait-based assortative mating, and reproductive isolation by active selection have demonstrated that ecological speciation is a common means by which new species arise. Evidence for mutation-order speciation by natural selection is more limited and has been best documented by instances of reproductive isolation resulting from intragenomic conflict. However, we still have not identified all aspects of selection, and identifying the underlying genes for reproductive isolation remains challenging.},

  Abstract                 = {Species originate frequently by natural selection. A general mechanism by which this occurs is ecological speciation, defined as the evolution of reproductive isolation between populations as a result of ecologically-based divergent natural selection. The alternative mechanism is mutation-order speciation in which populations fix different mutations as they adapt to similar selection pressures. Although numerous cases now indicate the importance of ecological speciation in nature, very little is known about the genetics of the process. Here, we summarize the genetics of premating and postzygotic isolation and the role of standing genetic variation in ecological speciation. We discuss the role of selection from standing genetic variation in threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a complex of species whose ancestral marine form repeatedly colonized and adapted to freshwater environments. We propose that ecological speciation has occurred multiple times in parallel in this group via a "transporter" process in which selection in freshwater environments repeatedly acts on standing genetic variation that is maintained in marine populations by export of freshwater-adapted alleles from elsewhere in the range. Selection from standing genetic variation is likely to play a large role in ecological speciation, which may partly account for its rapidity.},

These studies provide a wealth of new examples of apparent character displacement, and show that adaptive radiations may unfold in a predictable sequence.},

We identified and characterized a genome-wide set of SNP markers by generating 10,706 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from cDNA libraries derived from 6 different accessions, and by analysis of 606 sequence tagged sites (STS) from up to 12 accessions of the model flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The cDNA libraries for EST sequencing were made from individuals that were stressed by various means to enrich for transcripts from genes expressed under such conditions. SNPs discovered in these sequences may be useful markers for mapping genes involved in interactions with the biotic and abiotic environment. The STS loci are distributed randomly over the genome. By comparison with the Col-0 genome sequence, we identified a total of 8051 SNPs and 637 insertion/deletion polymorphisms (InDel). Analysis of STS-derived SNPs shows that most SNPs are rare, but that it is possible to identify intermediate frequency framework markers that can be used for genetic mapping in many different combinations of accessions. A substantial proportion of SNPs located in ORFs caused a change of the encoded amino acid. A comparison of the density of our SNP markers among accessions in both the EST and STS datasets, revealed that Cvi-0 is the most divergent accession from Col-0 among the 12 accessions studied. All of these markers are freely available via the internet.},

  Abstract                 = {There is increasing evidence that phenotypic plasticity can promote population divergence by facilitating phenotypic diversification and, eventually, genetic divergence. When a ‚Äòplastic‚Äô population colonizes a new habitat, it has the possibility to occupy multiple niches by expressing several distinct phenotypes. These initially reflect the population's plastic range but may later become genetically fixed by selection via the process of ‚Äògenetic assimilation‚Äô (GA). Through this process multiple specialized sister lineages can arise that share a common plastic ancestor ‚Äì the ‚Äòflexible stem‚Äô. Here, we review possible molecular mechanisms through which natural selection could fix an initially plastic trait during GA. These mechanisms could also explain how GA may contribute to cryptic genetic variation that can subsequently be coopted into other phenotypes or traits, but also lead to nonadaptive responses. We outline the predicted patterns of genetic and transcriptional divergence accompanying flexible stem radiations. The analysis of such patterns of (retained) adaptive and nonadaptive plastic responses within and across radiating lineages can inform on the state of ongoing GA. We conclude that, depending on the stability of the environment, the molecular architecture underlying plastic traits can facilitate diversification, followed by fixation and consolidation of an adaptive phenotype and degeneration of nonadaptive ones. Additionally, the process of GA may increase the cryptic genetic variation of populations, which on one hand may serve as substrate for evolution, but on another may be responsible for nonadaptive responses that consolidate local allopatry and thus reproductive isolation.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic variability of the non-marine ostracod species Darwinula stevensoni was estimated by sequencing part of the nuclear and the mitochondrial genome. As Darwinulidae are believed to be ancient asexuals, accumulation of mutations should have occurred, both between alleles within lineages and between lineages, during the millions of years of parthenogenetic reproduction. However, our sequence data show the opposite: no variability in the nuclear ITS1 region was observed within or among individuals of D. stevensoni, despite sampling a geographical range from Finland to South Africa. Lack of allelic divergence might be explained by concerted evolution of rDNA repeats. Homogeneity among individuals may be caused either by slow molecular evolution in ITS1 or by a recent selective sweep. Variability of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COI) was similar to intraspecific levels in other invertebrates, thus weakening the latter hypothesis. Calibrating interspecific, genetic divergences among D. stevensoni and other Darwinulidae using their fossil record enabled us to estimate rates of molecular evolution. Both COI and ITS1 evolve half as fast, at most, in darwinulids as in other invertebrates, and molecular evolution has significantly slowed down in ITS1 of D. stevensoni relative to other darwinulids. A reduced ITS1 mutation rate might explain this inconsistency between nuclear and mitochondrial evolution in D. stevensoni. },

  Abstract                 = {Parthenogenetic lineages within non-marine ostracods can occur either in mixed (with sexual and asexual females) or exclusively asexual taxa. The former mode of reproduction is associated with a high intraspecific diversity at all levels (genetic, morphological, ecological) and, at least in the Cypridoidea, with geographical parthenogenesis. Obligate asexuality is restricted to the Darwinuloidea, the strongest candidate for an ancient asexual animal group after the bdelloid rotifers, and is characterized by low diversity. We have compared rates of molecular evolution for the nuclear ITS1 region and the mitochondrial COT gene amongst the three major lineages of non-marine ostracods with sexual, mixed and asexual reproduction. Absolute rates of molecular evolution are low for both regions in the darwinulids. The slow-down of evolution in ITS1 that has been observed for Darwinula stevensoni (Brady & Robertson) apparently does not occur in other darwinulid species. ITS1 evolves more slowly than COT within non-marine ostracod families, including the darwinulids, but not between superfamilies. The ancient asexuals might have a higher relative substitution rate in ITS1, as would be expected from hypotheses that predict the accumulation of mutations in asexuals. However, the speed-up of ITS could also be ancient, for example through the stochastic loss of most lineages within the superfamily after the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. In this case, the difference in rate would have occurred independently from any effects of asexual reproduction. (C) 2003 The Linnean Society of London. },

The emergence of large genomic and environmental data sets, as well as the increasing sophistication of population genetics methods, provides an opportunity to characterize these patterns in relation to the environment. Landscape genetics has emerged as a flexible analytical framework that connects patterns of adaptive genetic variation to environmental heterogeneity in a spatially explicit context. Recent growth in this field has led to the development of numerous spatial statistical methods, prompting a discussion of the current benefits and limitations of these approaches. Here we provide a review of the design of landscape genetics studies, the different statistical tools, some important case studies, and perspectives on how future advances in this field are likely to shed light on important processes in evolution and ecology. },

  Abstract                 = {The genomes of contemporary humans contain considerable information about the history of our species. Although the general contours of human evolutionary history have been defined with increasing resolution throughout the past several decades, the continuing deluge of massively large sequencing data sets presents new opportunities and challenges for understanding human evolutionary history. Here, we review the signatures that demographic history imparts on patterns of DNA sequence variation, statistical methods that have been developed to leverage information contained in genome-scale data sets and insights gleaned from these studies. We also discuss the importance of using exploratory analyses to assess data quality, the strengths and limitations of commonly used population genomics methods, and factors that confound population genomics inferences.},

Nine types of such neurons could be found and characterized; eight of those could additionally be compared to corresponding neuron types previously known from other species. As shown in detail for one selected type, the neurons of the stridulation pattern generator are very similar in their anatomical appearance, and possess similar physiological qualities at least in two species with similar stridulation patterns. Stridulation interneurons of species with largely different stridulatory motor patterns have a similar morphology, but show a different activation timing throughout the stridulation. Nevertheless, special properties such as resetting or initiation capability of certain stridulation interneurons seem to be conserved throughout the species. The results suggest that the stridulation pattern generator of different species consists of a uniform set of interneurons that change their activity pattern to produce species-specific song movements.},

  Abstract                 = {Prezygotic mating isolation has been a major interest of evolutionary biologists during the past several decades because it is likely to represent one of the first stages in the transition from populations to species. Mate discrimination is one of the most commonly measured forms of prezygotic isolation and appears to be relatively common among closely related species. In some cases, it has been used as a measure to distinguish populations from subspecies, races, and sister species, yet the influences of various evolutionary mechanisms that may generate mate discrimination are largely unknown. In this study, we measured the level and pattern of mate discrimination among 18 populations of a cosmopolitan drosophilid species, Drosophila ananassae, from throughout its geographical range and its sister species, Drosophila pallidosa, which has a restricted geographical distribution in the South Pacific Islands. In addition, we measured genetic differentiation between all 18 populations using mitochondrial DNA polymorphism data. Mate discrimination varies considerably throughout the species range, being higher among populations outside the ancestral Indonesian range, and highest in the South Pacific. Our results suggest that colonization and genetic differentiation may have an influence on the evolutionary origin of mate discrimination. Our phylogeographical approach clarifies the ancestral relationships of several populations from the South Pacific that show particularly strong mate discrimination and suggests that they may be in the early stages of speciation. Furthermore, both the genetic and behavioral results cast doubt on the status of D. pallidosa as a good species.},

Although assembling a new genome can still be costly and difficult, it is possible to use RNA-seq to sequence mRNA. In the absence of a known genome, it is necessary to assemble these sequences de novo, taking into account possible alternative isoforms and the dynamic range of expression values.Results: We present a software package named Oases designed to heuristically assemble RNA-seq reads in the absence of a reference genome, across a broad spectrum of expression values and in presence of alternative isoforms. It achieves this by using an array of hash lengths, a dynamic filtering of noise, a robust resolution of alternative splicing events, and the efficient merging of multiple assemblies. It was tested on human and mouse RNA-seq data and is shown to improve significantly on the transABySS and Trinity de novo transcriptome assemblers.Availability: Oases is freely available under the GPL license at www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oases/Contact: dzerbino@ucsc.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary information is available at Bioinformatics online.},

  Abstract                 = {When two diverging species begin hybridizing, selection against hybridization is likely driven not by single substitutions, but by interactions between incompatible mutations. To identify these incompatibilities in natural populations, researchers examine the extent of nonrandom associations between ancestry at physically unlinked loci in admixed populations. In this approach, which we call ‚ÄòAD scans‚Äô, locus pairs with significantly positive ‚Äòancestry disequilibrium‚Äô (AD, i.e. locus pairs that positively covary by ancestry) represent incompatible alleles. Past research has uniformly revealed an excess of locus pairs with significantly positive AD, suggesting that dozens to hundreds of incompatibilities separate species. With forward simulations, we show that many realistic demographic scenarios, including recent and/or ongoing hybridization, generate a bias towards positive ancestry disequilibrium. We suggest steps that researchers can take to avoid pitfalls in interpreting AD scans, and present a novel measure of AD, which minimizes but does not fully eliminate bias in the AD distribution. We also show, by simulation, that the tail of the AD distribution is enriched for true incompatibilities. To illustrate the potential power and appropriate caution in interpretation of AD scans, we reanalyse previously published data from two admixed populations of Xiphophorus fishes. Our results imply that the prevalence of positive LD in admixed populations does not in itself support the idea that two-locus incompatibilities are widespread, but the co-enrichment of top AD hits across the two Xiphophorus populations supports the idea that AD scans can identify candidate interspecific incompatibilities.},

Despite the growing number of documented cases, we still know relatively little about how genomes evolve and stabilize following hybridization, and to what extent hybridization is functionally relevant. Here, we examine the case of Xiphophorus nezahualcoyotl, a teleost fish whose genome exhibits significant hybrid ancestry. We show that hybridization was relatively ancient and is unlikely to be ongoing. Strikingly, the genome of X.¬†nezahualcoyotl has largely stabilized following hybridization, distinguishing it from examples such as human‚ÄìNeanderthal hybridization. Hybridization-derived regions are remarkably distinct from other regions of the genome, tending to be enriched in genomic regions with reduced constraint. These results suggest that selection has played a role in removing hybrid ancestry from certain functionally important regions. Combined with findings in other systems, our results raise many questions about the process of genomic stabilization and the role of selection in shaping patterns of hybrid ancestry in the genome.},

  Abstract                 = {Missing values are a common problem in genetic association studies concerned with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Since many statistical methods cannot handle missing values, such values need to be removed prior to the actual analysis. Considering only complete observations, however, often leads to an immense loss of information. Therefore, procedures are required that can be used to impute such missing values. In this study, an imputation procedure based on a weighted k nearest neighbors algorithm is presented. This approach, called KNNcatImpute, searches for the k SNPs that are most similar to the SNP whose missing values need to be replaced and uses these k SNPs to impute the missing values. Alternatively, KNNcatImpute can search for the k nearest subjects. In this situation, the missing values of an individual are imputed by considering subjects showing a DNA pattern similar to the one of this individual. In a comparison to other imputation approaches, KNNcatImpute shows the lowest rates of falsely imputed genotypes when applied to the SNP data from the GENICA study, a candidate SNP study dedicated to the identification of genetic and gene-environment interactions associated with sporadic breast cancer. Moreover, KNNcatImpute can also be applied to data from genome-wide association studies, as an application to a subset of the HapMap data demonstrates.},

The overall distribution of G(ST) values followed an L-shaped curve with most markers exhibiting low species differentiation (G(ST) < 0.01) and only a few loci reaching >10\% levels. Twelve percent of the loci exhibited significant G(ST) deviations to neutral expectations, suggesting that selection contributed to species divergence. Coding regions expressed higher differentiation than noncoding regions. Among the 389 markers, 158 could be mapped on the 12 linkage groups of the existing Q. robur genetic map. Outlier loci with large G(ST) values were distributed over 9 linkage groups. One cluster of three outlier loci was found within 0.51 cM; but significant autocorrelation of G(ST) was observed at distances <2 cM.

Here, we use a combination of analytical theory and explicit forward simulations to describe how selection against hybrid genotypes impacts patterns of introgression across genomic and geographic space. By describing how lineages move across the hybrid zone, in a model without coalescence, we add to modern understanding of how clines form and how parental haplotypes are broken up during introgression. Working with lineages makes it easy to see that clines form in about 1/s generations, where s is the strength of selection against hybrids, and linked clines persist over a genomic scale of 1/T, where T is the age, in generations, of the hybrid zone. Locally disadvantageous alleles tend to exist as small families, whose lineages trace back to the side from which they originated at speed s dispersal distances per generation. The lengths of continuous tracts of ancestry provide an additional source of information: blocks of ancestry surrounding incompatibilities can be substantially longer than the genomewide average block length at the same spatial location, an observation that might be used to identify candidate targets of selection.},

  Year                     = {2007},

  Abstract                 = {The coverage in this book is very different from a traditional introductory
statistics book or course (of which both authors have taught numerous times).
The goal of this book is to serve as a primer to higher level statistics for
researchers in biological fields. We chose topics to cover from current
bioinformatics literature and from available syllabi from the small but growing
number of courses titled something like ?Statistics for Bioinformatics?. Many
of the topics we have chosen (Markov Chains, multivariate analysis) are
considered advanced level topics, typically taught only to graduate level
students in statistics. We felt the need to bring down the level that these topics
are taught to accommodate interested people with non-statistical background. In
doing so we, as much as possible, eliminated using complicated equations and
mathematical language. As a cautionary note, we are not hoping to replace a
graduate level background in statistics, but we do hope to convey a conceptual
understanding and ability to perform some basic data analysis using these
concepts as well as better understand the vocabulary and concepts frequently
appearing in bioinfomatic literature. We anticipate that this will inspire further
interest in statistical study as well as make the reader a more educated consumer
of the bioinformatics literature, able to understand and analyze the statistical
techniques being used. This should also help open communication lines
between statisticians and researchers.
We (the authors) are both teachers who believe in learning by doing and feel
there would be little use in presenting statistical concepts without providing
examples using these concepts. In order to present applied examples, the
complexity of data analysis needed for bioinformatics requires a sophisticated
computer data analysis system. It is not true, as often misperceived by
researchers, that computer programming languages (such as Java or Perl) or
office applications (such as spreadsheets or database applications) can replace a 
statistical applications package. The majority of functionality needed to perform
sophisticated data analysis is found only in specialized statistical software. We
feel very fortunate to be able to obtain the software application R for use in this
book. R has been in active, progressive development by a team of top-notch
statisticians for several years. It has matured into one of the best, if not the best,
sophisticated data analysis programs available. What is most amazing about R is
that it completely free, making it wonderfully accessible to students and
researchers.
The structure of the R software is a base program, providing basic program
functionality, which can be added onto with smaller specialized program
modules called packages. One of the biggest growth areas in contributed
packages in recent years has come from bioinformatics researchers, who have
contributed packages for QTL and microarray analysis, among other
applications. Another big advantage is that because R is so flexible and
extensible, R can unify most (if not all) bioinformatics data analysis tasks in one
program with add-on packages. Rather than learn multiple tools, students and
researchers can use one consistent environment for many tasks. It is because of
the price of R, extensibility, and the growing use of R in bioinformatics that R
was chosen as the software for this book.
The ?disadvantage? of R is that there is a learning curve required to master its
use (however, this is the case with all statistical software). R is primarily a
command line environment and requires some minimal programming skills to
use. In the beginning of the book we cover enough ground to get one up and
running with R.. We are assuming the primary interest of the reader is to be an
applied user of this software and focus on introducing relevant packages and
how to use the available existing functionality effectively. However, R is a fully
extensible system and as an open source project, users are welcome to contribute
code. In addition, R is designed to interface well with other technologies,
including other programming languages and database systems. Therefore R will
appeal to computer scientists interested in applying their skills to statistical data.},

  Abstract                 = {Species richness and geographical phenotypic variation in East African lacustrine cichlids are often correlated with ecological specializations and limited dispersal. This study compares mitochondrial and microsatellite genetic diversity and structure among three sympatric rock-dwelling cichlids of Lake Tanganyika, Eretmodus cyanostictus, Tropheus moorii, and Ophthalmotilapia ventralis. The species represent three endemic, phylogenetically distinct tribes (Eretmodini, Tropheini, and Ectodini), and display divergent ecomorphological and behavioral specialization. Sample locations span both continuous, rocky shoreline and a potential dispersal barrier in the form of a muddy bay. High genetic diversity and population differentiation were detected in T. moorii and E. cyanostictus, whereas much lower variation and structure were found in O. ventralis. In particular, while a 7-km-wide muddy bay curtails dispersal in all three species to a similar extent, gene flow along mostly continuous habitat appeared to be controlled by distance in E. cyanostictus, further restricted by site philopatry and/or minor habitat discontinuities in T. moorii, and unrestrained in O. ventralis. In contrast to the general pattern of high gene flow along continuous shorelines in rock-dwelling cichlids of Lake Malawi, our study identifies differences in population structure among stenotopic Lake Tanganyika species. The amount of genetic differentiation among populations was not related to the degree of geographical variation of body color, especially since more phenotypic variation is observed in O. ventralis than in the genetically highly structured E. cyanostictus.},

  Abstract                 = {The maintenance of species integrity despite pervasive hybridization is ruled by the interplay between reproductive barriers. Endogenous postzygotic isolation will shape the patterns of introgression in hybrid zones, leading to variable outcomes depending on the genetic mechanism involved. Here, we analysed experimental and natural hybrid populations of Aegilops geniculata and Aegilops triuncialis to examine the genetics of species boundaries in the face of gene flow. Because long-terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) showing differential evolutionary trajectories are probably to affect hybrid dysgenesis and reproductive isolation between these wild wheat species, we addressed the impact of LTR-RTs in shaping introgression between them. Experimental settings involving artificial sympatry and enforced crossings quantified strong, but incomplete reproductive isolation, and highlighted asymmetrical endogenous postzygotic isolation between the two species. Natural hybrid zones located in the northern Golan Heights were analysed using plastid DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) marking random sequences, and sequence-specific amplified polymorphisms (SSAP) tracking insertions from six LTR-RT families. This analysis demonstrated asymmetrical introgression and genome reorganization. In comparison with random sequences and quiescent LTR-RTs, those LTR-RTs predicted to be activated following conflicting interactions in hybrids revealed differential introgression across the hybrid zones. As also reported for synthetic F1 hybrids, such LTR-RTs were specifically reorganized in the genomes of viable hybrids, confirming that conflicts between selfish LTR-RTs may represent key incompatibilities shaping species boundaries and fostering long-term species integrity in the face of gene flow.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of assortative mating is a key component of the process of speciation with gene flow. Several recent theoretical studies have pointed out, however, that sexual selection which can result from assortative mating may cause it to plateau at an intermediate level; this is primarily owing to search costs of individuals with extreme phenotypes and to assortative preferences developed by individuals with intermediate phenotypes. I explore the limitations of assortative mating further by analysing a simple model in which these factors have been removed. Specifically, I use a haploid two-population model to ask whether the existence of assortative mating is sufficient to drive the further evolution of assortative mating. I find that a weakening in the effective strength of sexual selection with strong assortment leads to the existence of both a peak level of trait differentiation and the evolution of an intermediate level of assortative mating that will cause that peak. This result is robust to the inclusion of local adaptation and different genetic architecture of the trait. The results imply the existence of fundamental limits to the evolution of assortment via sexual selection in this situation, with which other factors, such as search costs, may interact.},

Linkage disequilibrium between loci involved in postzygotic and premating isolation must often be built and maintained as the source of these species-specific genotypes. Here, I discuss proposed solutions to facilitate the establishment and maintenance of this linkage disequilibrium. I concentrate primarily on two such factors: one-allele versus two-allele mechanisms of premating isolation, and the form of selection against hybrids as it relates to its effect on the pathway between postzygotic and prezygotic isolation. The goal of this discussion is not to thoroughly review these factors, but instead to concentrate on aspects and implications of these solutions that are currently underemphasized in the speciation literature.},

  Abstract                 = {The pronounced and elaborate displays that often differ between closely related animal species have led to the common assumption that sexual selection is important in speciation, especially in geographically separated populations. We use population genetic models to examine the ability of Fisherian sexual selection to contribute to lasting species differentiation by isolating its effect after the onset of gene flow between allopatric populations. We show that when sexually selected traits are under ecologically divergent selection, the situation most favorable to speciation, mating preferences tend to introgress faster than trait alleles, causing sexual selection to counter the effects of local adaptation. As a consequence, the net amount of trait divergence often drops with stronger Fisherian sexual selection. Furthermore, alleles for progressively weaker preferences spread in this context until sexual selection is removed. The effects of pure Fisherian sexual selection on species maintenance are thus much more inhibitory than previously assumed.},

  Abstract                 = {Speciation with gene flow is greatly facilitated when traits subject to divergent selection also contribute to non-random mating. Such traits have been called magic traits, which could be interpreted to imply that they are rare, special, or unrealistic. Here, we question this assumption by illustrating that magic traits can be produced by a variety of mechanisms, including ones in which reproductive isolation arises as an automatic by-product of adaptive divergence. We also draw upon the theoretical literature to explore whether magic traits have a unique role in speciation or can be mimicked in their effects by physically linked trait-complexes. We conclude that magic traits are more frequent than previously perceived, but further work is needed to clarify their importance.},

  Abstract                 = {Although sexual selection is an important cause of display evolution, in socially monogamous species (e.g. many birds), displays continue after formation of the pair bond. Here, we consider that these displays evolve because they stimulate the partner to increase investment in offspring. Our study is motivated by elaborate mutual displays in species that are largely monomorphic and have long-term pair bonds (e.g. the great crested grebe, Podiceps cristatus) and by many empirical results evidencing that display manipulation affects parental investment. Using population genetic models, we show that a necessary condition for the permanent establishment of mutual displays in the pair bond is that the benefit of investment by the pair is more than twice that resulting from investment by a single individual. Pre-existing biases to respond to displays by increased investment are a necessary component of display evolution. We also consider examples where one sex (e.g. males) stimulates increased investment in offspring by the other sex. Here, display and additional investment cannot evolve permanently, but can increase and linger at high frequency for a long time before loss. We discuss how such transient effects may lead to the evolution of permanent displays as a result of evolution at additional loci.},

  Abstract                 = {Speciation is intimately associated with the evolution of sex-and-reproduction-related traits, including those affecting hybrid incompatibility (postzygotic isolation) and species recognition (prezygotic isolation). Genes controlling such traits are not randomly distributed in the genome but are particularly abundant on the sex chromosomes. However, the evolutionary consequences of the sex linkage of genes involved in speciation have been little explored. Here, we present simulations of a continent-island diploid model that examines the effects of reduced recombination using both autosomal and sex-linked inheritance. We show first that linkage between genes affecting postzygotic and prezygotic isolation leads to a positive feedback loop in which both are strengthened. As species recognition evolves, genes causing hybrid incompatibility will hitchhike along with those improving premating isolation, leading to stronger hybrid incompatibility and thus increased pressure for further preference divergence. Second, we show that this loop effect is generally enhanced by sex linkage, because recombination is eliminated in the heterogametic sex, leading to tighter effective linkage between the two classes of genes and because natural selection is more efficient at sex-linked loci, as recessive alleles are not masked by dominance in the heterogametic sex. Accordingly, hitchhiking can be important in promoting speciation and can also lead to increased postzygotic isolation through adaptive evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a new framework for the analysis of association studies, designed to allow untyped variants to be more effectively and directly tested for association with a phenotype. The idea is to combine knowledge on patterns of correlation among SNPs (e.g., from the International HapMap project or resequencing data in a candidate region of interest) with genotype data at tag SNPs collected on a phenotyped study sample, to estimate ("impute") unmeasured genotypes, and then assess association between the phenotype and these estimated genotypes. Compared with standard single-SNP tests, this approach results in increased power to detect association, even in cases in which the causal variant is typed, with the greatest gain occurring when multiple causal variants are present. It also provides more interpretable explanations for observed associations, including assessing, for each SNP, the strength of the evidence that it (rather than another correlated SNP) is causal. Although we focus on association studies with quantitative phenotype and a relatively restricted region (e.g., a candidate gene), the framework is applicable and computationally practical for whole genome association studies. Methods described here are implemented in a software package, Bim-Bam, available from the Stephens Lab website http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/software.html.},

* Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) provides high-resolution population genomic data at low cost, and has become an important component in ecological and evolutionary studies. As with all high-throughput technologies, analytic strategies require critical validation to ensure precise and unbiased interpretation.


* To test the impact of bioinformatic data processing on downstream population genetic inferences, we analysed mammalian RAD-seq data (>100 individuals) with 312 combinations of methodology (de novo vs. mapping to references of increasing divergence) and filtering criteria (missing data, HWE, FIS, coverage, mapping and genotype quality). In an effort to identify commonalities and biases in all pipelines, we computed summary statistics (nr. loci, nr. SNP, œÄ, Hetobs, FIS, FST, Ne and m) and compared the results to independent null expectations (isolation-by-distance correlation, expected transition-to-transversion ratio Ts/Tv and Mendelian mismatch rates of known parent‚Äìoffspring trios).


* We observed large differences between reference-based and de novo approaches, the former generally calling more SNPs and reducing FIS and Ts/Tv. Data completion levels showed little impact on most summary statistics, and FST estimates were robust across all pipelines. The site frequency spectrum was highly sensitive to the chosen approach as reflected in large variance of parameter estimates across demographic scenarios (single-population bottlenecks and isolation-with-migration model). Null expectations were best met by reference-based approaches, although contingent on the specific criteria.


* We recommend that RAD-seq studies employ reference-based approaches to a closely related genome, and due to the high stochasticity associated with the pipeline advocate the use of multiple pipelines to ensure robust population genetic and demographic inferences.

Genomic approaches have been suggested as a promising tool for conservation practice as scaling up to genome-wide data can improve traditional conservation genetic inferences and provide qualitatively novel insights. However, the generation of genomic data and subsequent analyses and interpretations remain challenging and largely confined to academic research in ecology and evolution. This generates a gap between basic research and applicable solutions for conservation managers faced with multifaceted problems. Before the real-world conservation potential of genomic research can be realized, we suggest that current infrastructures need to be modified, methods must mature, analytical pipelines need to be developed, and successful case studies must be disseminated to practitioners. },

The extent of this preference can be adjusted by slight variation of the PCR conditions. Being combined with the natural tendency of PCR to amplify shorter fragments more efficiently than longer ones, it allows one to regulate the average length of the complex PCR product over a very wide range to make it most suitable for further manipulations. The technique can be used for amplifying any complex DNA sample.},

  Abstract                 = {Hindlimb loss has evolved repeatedly in many different animals by means of molecular mechanisms that are still unknown. To determine the number and type of genetic changes underlying pelvic reduction in natural populations, we carried out genetic crosses between threespine stickleback fish with complete or missing pelvic structures. Genome-wide linkage mapping shows that pelvic reduction is controlled by one major and four minor chromosome regions. Pitx1 maps to the major chromosome region controlling most of the variation in pelvic size. Pelvic-reduced fish show the same left-right asymmetry seen in Pitx1 knockout mice, but do not show changes in Pitx1 protein sequence. Instead, pelvic-reduced sticklebacks show site-specific regulatory changes in Pitx1 expression, with reduced or absent expression in pelvic and caudal fin precursors. Regulatory mutations in major developmental control genes may provide a mechanism for generating rapid skeletal changes in natural populations, while preserving the essential roles of these genes in other processes.},

The four species we investigated are mosquitoes of the Anopheles minimus group: An. aconitus, An. varuna and An. minimus species A and C. The formally named species are vectors of human malaria parasites in south-east Asia but are difficult to distinguish with certainty on the basis of morphology. Allele-specific amplification was used to differentiate An. minimus A from An. minimus C. This technique has been widely used for the diagnosis of species. Single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs) were used to separate all four species. This technique, which has seldom been used for species identification, has many advantages: it does not require sequence information beyond that needed for amplification; it is ideally suited for the detection of heterozygotes; it utilizes more of the information in the PCR product than allele-specific amplification; it distinguishes all four species considered here and could easily be extended to other species; previously unknown intraspecific variation and additional species are likely to be detected. Thus, SSCPs provide valuable population genetic information which allele-specific amplification does not.},

A genetic analysis of both generation means and within family variances reveals that the control of chiasma frequency in these lines is governed by a large additive genetic component (d) and a small dominance component (h) directed towards high frequency types. 4:0% of the total variance can be explained in terms of environmentally induced variation. It is argued that such significant and readily induced changes in the chiasma pattern, associated with a mean cellular difference of 4 chiasmata, can be expected to lead to an alteration in the linkage relationships within the genomes of each line. Unfortunately the intensity of the effect upon linked non-allelic associations can only be assumed since, at the present time, there is no evidence to correlate chiasma frequency variation in the parent with ensuing exophenotypic variation among the progeny.},

The mean of the base population was 20.4. Realised heritability estimates for both the high and low lines were 27.4% and 48.8% respectively; only the latter value is significant. The non-significant value in the high line has resulted either from unidirectional dominance or because the genes responsible for high chiasma values themselves undergo a higher recombination rate in high frequency individuals and thus reduce the response to selection. It is suggested that the genes governing chiasma frequency can be regarded as mainly neutral due to the large additive genetic component, at least in low chiasma frequency types. Accordingly, chiasma/requency variation and its adaptive signif- icance may not be such an important component of "fitness" as has been proposed in the past.},

If such inferences are reliable, mtDNA phylogenies should be congruent with phylogenies based on other data. In previous work, a mtDNA phylogeny suggested that diversification of the Hawaiian cricket genus Laupala was initiated by single invasions into each of several Hawaiian islands, followed by multiple sympatric divergences within each island. In contrast, a systematic hypothesis based on morphology argues that speciation in Laupala has occurred primarily in allopatry, with two independent species radiations diversifying across the archipelago. In this study, I analyze nuclear DNA (nDNA) sequences from Laupala to compare with sequences from the mtDNA. The nDNA phylogeny corroborates the hypothesis of allopatric divergence and multiple invasions, and when compared with mtDNA patterns, suggests that interspecific hybridization is a persistent feature of the history of Laupala. The discrepancy between mtDNA and nDNA phylogenies reveals that speciation histories based on mtDNA alone can be extensively misleading.},

  Abstract                 = {Porous species boundaries are characterized by differential gene flow, where some regions of the genome experience divergent evolution while others experience the homogenizing effects of gene flow. If species can arise or remain distinct despite gene flow between them, speciation can only be understood on a gene by gene level. To understand the genetics of speciation, we therefore must identify the targets of selection that cause divergent evolution and identify the genetic architecture underlying such "speciation phenotypes". This will enable characterization of genomic regions that are "free to flow" between species, and those that diverge in the face of gene flow. We discuss this problem in the genus Laupala, a morphologically cryptic, flightless group of crickets that has radiated in Hawaii. Because songs are used in courtship and always distinguish close relatives of Laupala as well as species in sympatry, we argue that songs in Laupala are speciation phenotypes. Here, we present our approaches to identify the underlying genomic regions and song genes that differentiate closely related species. We discuss what is known about the genetic basis of this species difference derived from classic quantitative genetics and quantitative trait locus mapping experiments. We also present a model of the molecular expression of cricket song to assist in our goal to identify the genes involved in song variation. As most species are sympatric and exchange genes with congeners, we discuss the importance of understanding the genetic and genomic architecture of song as a speciation phenotype that must be characterized to identify differential patterns of gene flow at porous species boundaries.},

In this article, we argue that a dissection of specific aspects of the genetic architecture of such traits in a comparative context can allow us to rule out some mechanisms of divergence. We discuss these ideas with reference to our investigation of intersexual communication behaviors involved in mate recognition in the Hawaiian cricket genus Laupala. Different species of Laupala sing distinctively and show species-specific acoustic preferences. We focus on the sister species Laupala paranigra and Laupala kohalensis, characterized by differences in these classic courtship phenotypes. We discuss our preliminary results on the directionality of effect of substituted alleles underlying these species differences. We then discuss these results in the context of historical inference, a necessary perspective for testing the genomic predictions made by theories of speciation that focus on evolution of mate recognition systems.},

  Abstract                 = {In mate recognition systems, the functional necessity to coordinate traits involved in sexual communication should result in reduced pairing potential for new variants outside the distribution of common reproductive signals. Yet, many closely related, sexual species differ in mate recognition traits, suggesting that directional selection influences the divergence of mate recognition systems. Species of the endemic Hawaiian cricket genus Laupala are morphologically and ecologically cryptic, although both male calling song and female acoustic preference have diverged rapidly between closely related species. These mate recognition phenotypes are therefore often likely to be speciation phenotypes, i.e. traits whose divergence contributes, directly or indirectly, to a reduction of gene flow during speciation, given their frequent participation in early lineage divergence. We conducted a replicated, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping study of the genetic basis of differences in male calling song between two closely related species, Laupala paranigra and Laupala kohalensis, allowing us to examine the genetic basis of traits involved in rapid speciation. We found statistical support for eight QTL in one replicate, with at least four of these QTL mapping to the same regions in a second replicate. QTL effects ranged between 3.0\% and 10.7\% of the difference in pulse rate between L. paranigra and L. kohalensis, and are thus of moderate to small effect. All QTL identified show directional effects consistent with the hypothesis of directional selection. Thus, we conclude that rapid speciation can occur under the influence of many genes of moderate to small effect.

Searching similar pairs from a string pool is a fundamental process of de novo genome assembly, genome-wide alignment and other important analyses.Results: In this study, we designed and implemented an exact algorithm SlideSort that finds all similar pairs from a string pool in terms of edit distance. Using an efficient pattern growth algorithm, SlideSort discovers chains of common k-mers to narrow down the search. Compared to existing methods based on single k-mers, our method is more effective in reducing the number of edit distance calculations. In comparison to backtracking methods such as BWA, our method is much faster in finding remote matches, scaling easily to tens of millions of sequences. Our software has an additional function of single link clustering, which is useful in summarizing short reads for further processing.Availability: Executable binary files and C++ libraries are available at http://www.cbrc.jp/~shimizu/slidesort/ for Linux and Windows.Contact: slidesort@m.aist.go.jp; shimizu-kana@aist.go.jpSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the nature of evolutionary relationships among persons and populations is important for the efficient application of genome science to biomedical research. We have analysed 8,525 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 84 individuals from four populations: African-American, European-American, Chinese and Japanese. Individual relationships were reconstructed using the allele sharing distance and the neighbour-joining tree making method. Trees show clear clustering according to population, with the root branching from the African-American clade. The African-American cluster is much less star-like than European-American and East Asian clusters, primarily because of admixture. Furthermore, on the East Asian branch, all ten Chinese individuals cluster together and all ten Japanese individuals cluster together. Using positional information, we demonstrate strong correlations between inter-marker distance and both locus-specific FST (the proportion of total variation due to differentiation) levels and branch lengths. Chromosomal maps of the distribution of locus-specific branch lengths were constructed by combining these data with other published SNP markers (total of 33,704 SNPs). These maps clearly illustrate a non-uniform distribution of human genetic substructure, an instructional and useful paradigm for education and research.},

  Abstract                 = {It is now widely accepted that post-zygotic reproductive isolation is the result of negative epistatic interactions between derived alleles fixed independently at different loci in diverging populations (the Dobzhansky-Muller model). What is less clear is the nature of the loci involved and whether the derived alleles increase in frequency through genetic drift, or as a result of natural or sexual selection. If incompatible alleles are fixed by selection, transient polymorphisms will be rare and clines for these alleles will be steep where divergent populations meet. If they evolve by drift, populations are expected to harbour substantial genetic variation in compatibility and alleles will introgress across hybrid zones once they recombine onto a genetic background with which they are compatible. Here we show that variation in male sterility in a naturally occurring Chorthippus parallelus grasshopper hybrid zone conforms to the neutral expectations. Asymmetrical clines for male sterility have long tails of introgression and populations distant from the zone centre show significant genetic variation for compatibility. Our data contrast with recent observations on 'speciation genes' that have diverged as a result of strong natural selection.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The evolutionary lineage leading to the teleost fish underwent a whole genome duplication termed FSGD or 3R in addition to two prior genome duplications that took place earlier during vertebrate evolution (termed 1R and 2R). Resulting from the FSGD, additional copies of genes are present in fish, compared to tetrapods whose lineage did not experience the 3R genome duplication. Interestingly, we find that ParaHox genes do not differ in number in extant teleost fishes despite their additional genome duplication from the genomic situation in mammals, but they are distributed over twice as many paralogous regions in fish genomes. RESULTS: We determined the DNA sequence of the entire ParaHox C1 paralogon in the East African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, and compared it to orthologous regions in other vertebrate genomes as well as to the paralogous vertebrate ParaHox D paralogons. Evolutionary relationships among genes from these four chromosomal regions were studied with several phylogenetic algorithms. We provide evidence that the genes of the ParaHox C paralogous cluster are duplicated in teleosts, just as it had been shown previously for the D paralogon genes. Overall, however, synteny and cluster integrity seems to be less conserved in ParaHox gene clusters than in Hox gene clusters. Comparative analyses of non-coding sequences uncovered conserved, possibly co-regulatory elements, which are likely to contain promoter motives of the genes belonging to the ParaHox paralogons. CONCLUSION: There seems to be strong stabilizing selection for gene order as well as gene orientation in the ParaHox C paralogon, since with a few exceptions, only the lengths of the introns and intergenic regions differ between the distantly related species examined. The high degree of evolutionary conservation of this gene cluster's architecture in particular - but possibly clusters of genes more generally - might be linked to the presence of promoter, enhancer or inhibitor motifs that serve to regulate more than just one gene. Therefore, deletions, inversions or relocations of individual genes could destroy the regulation of the clustered genes in this region. The existence of such a regulation network might explain the evolutionary conservation of gene order and orientation over the course of hundreds of millions of years of vertebrate evolution. Another possible explanation for the highly conserved gene order might be the existence of a regulator not located immediately next to its corresponding gene but further away since a relocation or inversion would possibly interrupt this interaction. Different ParaHox clusters were found to have experienced differential gene loss in teleosts. Yet the complete set of these homeobox genes was maintained, albeit distributed over almost twice the number of chromosomes. Selection due to dosage effects and/or stoichiometric disturbance might act more strongly to maintain a modal number of homeobox genes (and possibly transcription factors more generally) per genome, yet permit the accumulation of other (non regulatory) genes associated with these homeobox gene clusters.},

  Abstract                 = {Genome assemblies are now available for nine primate species, and large-scale sequencing projects are underway or approved for six others. An explicitly evolutionary and phylogenetic approach to comparative genomics, called phylogenomics, will be essential in unlocking the valuable information about evolutionary history and genomic function that is contained within these genomes. However, most phylogenomic analyses so far have ignored the effects of variation in ancestral populations on patterns of sequence divergence. These effects can be pronounced in the primates, owing to large ancestral effective population sizes relative to the intervals between speciation events. In particular, local genealogies can vary considerably across loci, which can produce biases and diminished power in many phylogenomic analyses of interest, including phylogeny reconstruction, the identification of functional elements, and the detection of natural selection. At the same time, this variation in genealogies can be exploited to gain insight into the nature of ancestral populations. In this Perspective, I explore this area of intersection between phylogenetics and population genetics, and its implications for primate phylogenomics. I begin by "lifting the hood'' on the conventional tree-like representation of the phylogenetic relationships between species, to expose the population-genetic processes that operate along its branches. Next, I briefly review an emerging literature that makes use of the complex relationships among coalescence, recombination, and speciation to produce inferences about evolutionary histories, ancestral populations, and natural selection. Finally, I discuss remaining challenges and future prospects at this nexus of phylogenetics, population genetics, and genomics. },

  Abstract                 = {We have conducted a comprehensive search for conserved elements in vertebrate genomes, using genome-wide multiple alignments of five vertebrate species (human, mouse, rat, chicken, and Fugu rubripes). Parallel searches have been performed with multiple alignments of four insect species (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae), two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces. Conserved elements were identified with a computer program called phastCons, which is based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons works by fitting a phylo-HMM to the data by maximum likelihood, subject to constraints designed to calibrate the model across species groups, and then predicting conserved elements based on this model. The predicted elements cover roughly 3\%-8\% of the human genome (depending on the details of the calibration procedure) and substantially higher fractions of the more compact Drosophila melanogaster (37\%-53\%), Caenorhabditis elegans (18\%-37\%), and Saccharaomyces cerevisiae (47\%-68\%) genomes. From yeasts to vertebrates, in order of increasing genome size and general biological complexity, increasing fractions of conserved bases are found to lie outside of the exons of known protein-coding genes. In all groups, the most highly conserved elements (HCEs), by log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of bases long. These elements share certain properties with ultraconserved elements, but they tend to be longer and less perfectly conserved, and they overlap genes of somewhat different functional categories. In vertebrates, HCEs are associated with the 3' UTRs of regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding sequences. Noncoding HCEs also show strong statistical evidence of an enrichment for RNA secondary structure.},

* Despite the advancement of phylogenetic methods to estimate speciation and extinction rates, their power can be limited under variable rates, in particular for clades with high extinction rates and small number of extant species. Fossil data can provide a powerful alternative source of information to investigate diversification processes.


* Here, we present PyRate, a computer program to estimate speciation and extinction rates and their temporal dynamics from fossil occurrence data. The rates are inferred in a Bayesian framework and are comparable to those estimated from phylogenetic trees.


* We describe how PyRate can be used to explore different models of diversification. In addition to the diversification rates, it provides estimates of the parameters of the preservation process (fossilization and sampling) and the times of speciation and extinction of each species in the data set. Moreover, we develop a new birth‚Äìdeath model to correlate the variation of speciation/extinction rates with changes of a continuous trait.


* Finally, we demonstrate the use of Bayes factors for model selection and show how the posterior estimates of a PyRate analysis can be used to generate calibration densities for Bayesian molecular clock analysis. PyRate is an open-source command-line Python program available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyrate/.

To address this limitation, we developed ABySS (Assembly By Short Sequences), a parallelized sequence assembler. As a demonstration of the capability of our software, we assembled 3.5 billion paired-end reads from the genome of an African male publicly released by Illumina, Inc. Approximately 2.76 million contigs > or =100 base pairs (bp) in length were created with an N50 size of 1499 bp, representing 68\% of the reference human genome. Analysis of these contigs identified polymorphic and novel sequences not present in the human reference assembly, which were validated by alignment to alternate human assemblies and to other primate genomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Phenotypically cryptic lineages comprise an important yet understudied part of biodiversity; in particular, we have much to learn about how these lineages are formed and maintained. To better understand the evolutionary significance of such lineages, we studied a hybrid zone between two morphologically cryptic phylogeographic lineages in the rainforest lizard, Lampropholis coggeri. Analyzing a multilocus genetic dataset through cline inference, individual-based methods and population measures of disequilibrium and using simulations to explore our genetic results in context of theoretical expectations, we inferred the processes maintaining this hybrid zone. We find that these lineages meet in a hybrid zone that is narrow (?400 m) relative to inferred dispersal rate. Further, the hybrid zone exhibits substantial genetic disequilibrium and sharply coincident and largely concordant clines. Based on our knowledge about the region's biogeography, the species' natural history, and our simulation results, we suggest that strong selection against hybrids structures this system. As all clines show a relatively narrow range of introgression, we posit that this hybrid zone might not yet be in equilibrium. Nonetheless, our results clearly show that phylogeographic lineages can evolve substantial reproductive isolation without concomitant morphological diversification, suggesting that such lineages can constitute a significant component of evolutionary diversity.},

With next generation sequencing technologies it is possible to obtain genetic data for all accessible genetic variations in the genome. Existing methods for admixture analysis rely on known genotypes. However, individual genotypes cannot be inferred from low-depth sequencing data without introducing errors. This article presents a new method for inferring an individual's ancestry that takes the uncertainty introduced in next generation sequencing data into account. This is achieved by working directly with genotype likelihoods that contain all relevant information of the unobserved genotypes. Using simulations as well as publicly available sequencing data, we demonstrate that the presented method has great accuracy even for very low-depth data. At the same time, we demonstrate that applying existing methods to genotypes called from the same data can introduce severe biases. The presented method is implemented in the NGSadmix software available at http://www.popgen.dk/software.},

  Abstract                 = {The advances in sequencing technology have made large-scale sequencing studies for large cohorts feasible. Often, the primary goal for large-scale studies is to identify genetic variants associated with a disease or other phenotypes. Even when deep sequencing is performed, there will be many sites where there is not enough data to call genotypes accurately. Ignoring the genotype classification uncertainty by basing subsequent analyses on called genotypes leads to a loss in power. Additionally, using called genotypes can lead to spurious association signals. Some methods taking the uncertainty of genotype calls into account have been proposed; most require numerical optimization which for large-scale data is not always computationally feasible. We show that using a score statistic for the joint likelihood of observed phenotypes and observed sequencing data provides an attractive approach to association testing for next-generation sequencing data. The joint model accounts for the genotype classification uncertainty via the posterior probabilities of the genotypes given the observed sequencing data, which gives the approach higher power than methods based on called genotypes. This strategy remains computationally feasible due to the use of score statistics. As part of the joint likelihood, we model the distribution of the phenotypes using a generalized linear model framework, which works for both quantitative and discrete phenotypes. Thus, the method presented here is applicable to case-control studies as well as mapping of quantitative traits. The model allows additional covariates that enable correction for confounding factors such as population stratification or cohort effects.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping is frequently used in evolutionary studies to understand the genetic architecture of continuously varying traits. The majority of studies have been conducted in specially created crosses, in which genetic differences between parental lines are identified by linkage analysis. Detecting QTL segregating within populations is more problematic, especially in wild populations, because these populations typically have complicated and unbalanced multigenerational pedigrees. However, QTL mapping can still be conducted in such populations using a variance components mixed model approach, and the advent of appropriate statistical frameworks and better genotyping methods mean that the approach is gaining popularity. In this study it is shown that all studies described to date report evidence of QTL of major effect on trait variation, but that these findings are probably caused by inflated estimates of QTL effect sizes due to The Beavis Effect. Using simulations I show that even the most powerful studies conducted to date are likely to give misleading descriptions of the genetic architecture of a trait. I show that an interpretation of a mapping study of beak colour in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), that suggested genetic variation was determined by a small number of loci of large effect, which are possibly maintained by antagonistic pleiotropy, is likely to be incorrect. More generally, recommendations are made to how QTL mapping can be combined with other approaches to provide more accurate descriptions of a trait's genetic architecture.2013 The Author(s).

Here, we review some representative studies documenting chemosensory speciation in an attempt to evaluate the importance and the different aspects of the process in nature and to gain insights into the genetic basis and the evolutionary mechanisms of chemosensory trait divergence. Although most studies of chemosensory speciation concern sexual isolation mediated by pheromone divergence, especially in Drosophila and moth species, other chemically based behaviours (habitat choice, pollinator attraction) can also play an important role in speciation and are likely to do so in a wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate species. Adaptive divergence of chemosensory traits in response to factors such as pollinators, hosts and conspecifics commonly drives the evolution of chemical prezygotic barriers. Although the genetic basis of chemosensory speciation remains largely unknown, genomic approaches to chemosensory gene families and to enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways of signal compounds now provide new opportunities to dissect the genetic basis of these complex traits and of their divergence among taxa.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding how speciation can take place in the presence of homogenizing gene flow remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. In the early stages of ecological speciation, reproductive isolation between populations occupying different habitats is expected to be concentrated around genes for local adaptation. These genomic regions will show high divergence while gene exchange in other regions of the genome should continue relatively unimpaired, resulting in low levels of differentiation. The problem is to explain how speciation progresses from this point towards complete reproductive isolation, allowing genome-wide divergence. A new study by Via and West (2008) on speciation between host races of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, introduces the mechanism of `divergence hitchhiking' which can generate large `islands of differentiation' and facilitate the build-up of linkage disequilibrium, favouring increased reproductive isolation. This idea potentially removes a major stumbling block to speciation under continuous gene flow.},

Based on a multi-population approach, we investigated spatial patterns of divergence of mate preference in the two taxa. Mate preference was significantly higher in the contact zone than in allopatry in both subspecies, suggesting that reproductive character displacement occurs. Moreover, patterns of preference were stronger in M. m. musculus than in M. m. domesticus, indicating an asymmetrical divergence between the two. In the context of selection against hybridization, our results may provide empirical support for the hypothesis of reinforcement in a parapatric hybrid zone. We discuss factors that could explain the asymmetrical pattern of divergence and the possible impact of a unimodal structure on the maintenance of premating divergence between the two subspecies.},

  Abstract                 = {Mate choice is the outcome of sexual preference for partners carrying specific signals. Thus, mating among conspecifics (homogamy) depends on the occurrence of species recognition systems. We asked what happens if populations diverge, and we investigated female sexual preference between two subspecies of the house mouse in populations from the borders of a hybrid zone (Jutland, Denmark). We used choice tests to analyze the occurrence of recognition signals and to locate these signals in soiled bedding and urine. Our results show that populations of the two subspecies can be discriminated on the basis of urinary signals, suggesting that the latter have diverged. Additionally, these signals seem to have similar features in populations of different geographical origins, suggesting that subspecific differentiation occurs. This is the first demonstration that subspecific recognition through urinary signals occurs in the house mouse. However, while Mus musculus domesticus does not display a preference, we show that Mus musculus musculus females tend to mate with males of the same subspecies. We discuss the different factors that could explain these discrepancies between females of the two taxa: differences in signal perception, evolution at a different pace, or evolution under different selective pressures in their area of contact. Further, we propose that the divergence in male signal was at least partly initiated in allopatry and discuss different evolutionary scenario that may explain the patterns observed in Denmark and their relevance to isolation between the two taxa.},

Our study demonstrates that a strong assortative preference characterises one of the two subspecies (musculus) and that urinary signals are involved in this subspecies recognition. Taking into account the specific genetic and geographical characteristics of the Danish hybrid zone, we discuss the influence of the above pattern on its fate and the mechanisms that could have favoured this prezygotic divergence, among which the role of recombined populations constituting the core of the zone.},

The deduced 1851 amino acid protein belongs to the superfamily of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the sequence of this subunit is relatively distant from sodium channel alpha subunits and most similar to genes encoding the A, B, and E isoforms of calcium channel alpha1 subunits. To indicate its similarity to this subfamily of vertebrate isoforms, we name this protein Dmca1A, for Drosophila melanogaster calcium channel alpha1 subunit, type A. Northern blot analysis detected a single 10. 5 kb transcript class that is regulated developmentally, with expression peaks in the first larval instar, midpupal, and late pupal stages. In late-stage embryos, Dmca1A is expressed preferentially in the nervous system. Variant transcripts are generated by alternative splicing. In addition, single nucleotide variations between cDNAs and genomic sequence are consistent with RNA editing. Dmca1A maps to a chromosomal region implicated in, and is the likely candidate for, the gene involved in the generation of behavioral, physiological, and lethal phenotypes of the cacophony, nightblind-A, and lethal(1)L13 mutants.},

  Abstract                 = {An association between female remating behavior, oogenesis and oviposition was examined in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura to investigate mechanisms that elicit remating. Females receptive to remating oviposited more eggs in both species; however, the species differed in the association between remating behavior and the number and distribution of oocyte stages. We found no differences in the number of either developing eggs of different stages or mature eggs between female D. pseudoobscura that were either receptive or nonreceptive to remating. In contrast, D. melanogaster females that are receptive to remating had significantly more mature eggs in the ovaries than nonreceptive females. Nonremating females had a significantly greater number of immature, vitellogenic oocytes. These results suggest that factors associated with oogenesis are related to female remating behavior in D. melanogaster but not in D. pseudoobscura. We discuss these results in conjunction with other evidence on the role male ejaculatory components play in mediating female remating behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the processes underlying the origin of new species is a fundamental problem in evolutionary research. Whilst it has long been recognised that closely related taxa often differ markedly in reproductive characteristics, only relatively recently has sexual selection been evoked as a key promoter of speciation through its ability to generate reproductive isolation (RI). Sexual selection potentially can influence the probability that individuals from the same or different populations will reproduce successfully since it shapes precisely those traits involved in mating and reproduction. If reproductive characters diverge along different trajectories, then sexual selection can impact on the evolution of reproductive barriers operating both before and after mating. In this perspective, we consider some new advances in our understanding of the coevolution of male and female sexual signals and receptors and suggest how these developments may provide heretofore neglected insights into the mechanisms by which isolating barriers may emerge. Specifically, we explore how selfish genetic elements (SGEs) can mediate pre- and post-copulatory mate choice, thereby influencing gene flow and ultimately population divergence; we examine evidence from studies of intracellular spermâegg interactions and propose that intracellular gametic incompatibilities may arise after sperm entry into the egg, and thus contribute to RI; we review findings from genomic studies demonstrating rapid, adaptive evolution of reproductive genes in both sexes and discuss whether such changes are causal in determining RI or simply associated with it; and finally, we consider genetic, developmental and functional mechanisms that might constrain reproductive trait diversification, thereby limiting the scope for reproductive barriers to arise via sexual selection. We hope to stimulate work that will further the understanding of the role sexual selection plays in generating RI and ultimately speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {Since Darwin published the "Origin," great progress has been made in our understanding of speciation mechanisms. The early investigations by Mayr and Dobzhansky linked Darwin's view of speciation by adaptive divergence to the evolution of reproductive isolation, and thus provided a framework for studying the origin of species. However, major controversies and questions remain, including: When is speciation nonecological? Under what conditions does geographic isolation constitute a reproductive isolating barrier? and How do we estimate the "importance" of different isolating barriers? Here, we address these questions, providing historical background and offering some new perspectives. A topic of great recent interest is the role of ecology in speciation. "Ecological speciation" is defined as the case in which divergent selection leads to reproductive isolation, with speciation under uniform selection, polyploid speciation, and speciation by genetic drift defined as "nonecological." We review these proposed cases of nonecological speciation and conclude that speciation by uniform selection and polyploidy normally involve ecological processes. Furthermore, because selection can impart reproductive isolation both directly through traits under selection and indirectly through pleiotropy and linkage, it is much more effective in producing isolation than genetic drift. We thus argue that natural selection is a ubiquitous part of speciation, and given the many ways in which stochastic and deterministic factors may interact during divergence, we question whether the ecological speciation concept is useful. We also suggest that geographic isolation caused by adaptation to different habitats plays a major, and largely neglected, role in speciation. We thus provide a framework for incorporating geographic isolation into the biological species concept (BSC) by separating ecological from historical processes that govern species distributions, allowing for an estimate of geographic isolation based upon genetic differences between taxa. Finally, we suggest that the individual and relative contributions of all potential barriers be estimated for species pairs that have recently achieved species status under the criteria of the BSC. Only in this way will it be possible to distinguish those barriers that have actually contributed to speciation from those that have accumulated after speciation is complete. We conclude that ecological adaptation is the major driver of reproductive isolation, and that the term "biology of speciation," as proposed by Mayr, remains an accurate and useful characterization of the diversity of speciation mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Information about polymorphism, population structure, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) is crucial for association studies of complex trait variation. However, most genomewide studies have focused on model systems, with very few analyses of undisturbed natural populations. Here, we sequenced 86 mapped nuclear loci for a sample of 46 genotypes of Boechera stricta and two individuals of B. holboellii, both wild relatives of Arabidopsis. Isolation by distance was significant across the species range of B. stricta, and three geographic groups were identified by structure analysis, principal coordinates analysis, and distance-based phylogeny analyses. The allele frequency spectrum indicated a genomewide deviation from an equilibrium neutral model, with silent nucleotide diversity averaging 0.004. LD decayed rapidly, declining to background levels in approximately 10 kb or less. For tightly linked SNPs separated by <1 kb, LD was dependent on the reference population. LD was lower in the specieswide sample than within populations, suggesting that low levels of LD found in inbreeding species such as B. stricta, Arabidopsis thaliana, and barley may result from broad geographic sampling that spans heterogeneous genetic groups. Finally, analyses also showed that inbreeding B. stricta and A. thaliana have approximately 45\% higher recombination per kilobase than outcrossing A. lyrata.},

  Abstract                 = {Nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (numts) are non-functional fragments of mtDNA inserted into the nuclear genome. Numts are prevalent across eukaryotes and a positive correlation is known to exist between the number of numts and the genome size. Most numt surveys have relied on model organisms with fully sequenced nuclear genomes, but such analyses have limited utilities for making a generalization about the patterns of numt accumulation for any given clade. Among insects, the order Orthoptera is known to have the largest nuclear genome and it is also reported to include several species with a large number of numts. In this study, we use Orthoptera as a case study to document the diversity and abundance of numts by generating numts of three mitochondrial loci across 28 orthopteran families, representing the phylogenetic diversity of the order. We discover that numts are rampant in all lineages, but there is no discernable and consistent pattern of numt accumulation among different lineages. Likewise, we do not find any evidence that a certain mitochondrial gene is more prone to nuclear insertion than others. We also find that numt insertion must have occurred continuously and frequently throughout the diversification of Orthoptera. Although most numts are the result of recent nuclear insertion, we find evidence of very ancient numt insertion shared by highly divergent families dating back to the Jurassic period. Finally, we discuss several factors contributing to the extreme prevalence of numts in Orthoptera and highlight the importance of exploring the utility of numts in evolutionary studies.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of male mate choice is constrained by costs of choice in species with a male-biased operational sex ratio (OSR). Previous theoretical studies have shown that significant benefits of male choice are required, for example, by mating with more fecund females, in order for these costs to be offset and a male preference to spread. In a series of population genetic models we show the novel effect that male mating preference, expressed as a bias in courtship, can spread when females prefer, and thus are more likely to mate with, males who court more. We explore two female preference functions for levels of male courtship, one representing a threshold and the other a weighted female preference. The basic finding generally holds for both preference functions. However, the preference function greatly affects the spread of a male preference allele after the addition of competing males who can court more in total. Our results thus stress that a thorough understanding of the response of females to male courtship is a critical component to understanding male preference evolution in polygynous species.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in population genomics have triggered great interest in the genomic landscape of divergence in taxa with 'porous' species boundaries. One important obstable of previous studies of this topic was the low genomic coverage achieved. This issue can now be overcome by the use of 'next generation' or short-read DNA-sequencing approaches capable of assaying many thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in divergent species. We have scanned the 'porous' genomes of Populus alba and Populus tremula, two ecologically divergent hybridizing forest trees, using >38,000 SNPs assayed by restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. Windowed analyses indicate great variation in genetic divergence (e.g. the proportion of fixed SNPs) between species, and these results are unlikely to be strongly biased by genomic features of the Populus trichocarpa reference genome used for SNP calling. Divergence estimates were significantly autocorrelated (P < 0.01; Moran's I up to 0.6) along 11 of 19 chromosomes. Many of these autocorrelations involved low divergence blocks, thus suggesting that allele sharing was caused by recurrent gene flow rather than shared ancestral polymorphism. A conspicuous low divergence block of three megabases was detected on chromosome XIX, recently put forward as an incipient sex chromosome in Populus, and was largely congruent with introgression of mapped microsatellites in two natural hybrid zones (N > 400). Our results help explain the origin of the 'genomic mosaic' seen in these taxa with 'porous' genomes and suggest rampant introgression or extensive among-species conservation of an incipient plant sex chromosome. RAD sequencing holds great promise for detecting patterns of divergence and gene flow in highly divergent hybridizing species.},

  Abstract                 = {Using coalescent simulations, we study the impact of three different sampling schemes on patterns of neutral diversity in structured populations. Specifically, we are interested in two summary statistics based on the site frequency spectrum as a function of migration rate, demographic history of the entire substructured population (including timing and magnitude of specieswide expansions), and the sampling scheme. Using simulations implementing both finite-island and two-dimensional stepping-stone spatial structure, we demonstrate strong effects of the sampling scheme on Tajima's D (D(T)) and Fu and Li's D (D(FL)) statistics, particularly under specieswide (range) expansions. Pooled samples yield average D(T) and D(FL) values that are generally intermediate between those of local and scattered samples. Local samples (and to a lesser extent, pooled samples) are influenced by local, rapid coalescence events in the underlying coalescent process. These processes result in lower proportions of external branch lengths and hence lower proportions of singletons, explaining our finding that the sampling scheme affects D(FL) more than it does D(T). Under specieswide expansion scenarios, these effects of spatial sampling may persist up to very high levels of gene flow (Nm > 25), implying that local samples cannot be regarded as being drawn from a panmictic population. Importantly, many data sets on humans, Drosophila, and plants contain signatures of specieswide expansions and effects of sampling scheme that are predicted by our simulation results. This suggests that validating the assumption of panmixia is crucial if robust demographic inferences are to be made from local or pooled samples. However, future studies should consider adopting a framework that explicitly accounts for the genealogical effects of population subdivision and empirical sampling schemes.},

The H2 lineage is rare in Africans, almost absent in East Asians but found at a frequency of 20\% in Europeans, in whom the haplotype structure is indicative of a history of positive selection.

  Abstract                 = {Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously.We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10\% to 30\%. We show that missForest can successfully handle missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of variables. In our comparative study, missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data.The package missForest is freely available from http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/.stekhoven@stat.math.ethz.ch; buhlmann@stat.math.ethz.ch},

An approach to locating these genes in human cohort studies would be to use association analysis, which depends on linkage disequilibrium of flanking polymorphic DNA markers. In theory, a high degree of linkage disequilibrium between genes separated by 10-20 cM will be generated and persist in populations that have a history of recent (3-20 generations ago) admixture between genetically differentiated racial groups, such as has occurred in African Americans and Hispanic populations. We have conducted analytic and computer simulations to quantify the effect of genetic, genomic, and population parameters that affect the amount and ascertainment of linkage disequilibrium in populations with a history of genetic admixture. Our goal is to thoroughly explore the ranges of all relevant parameters or factors (e.g., sample size and degree of genetic differentiation between populations) that may be involved in gene localization studies, in hopes of prescribing guidelines for an efficient mapping strategy. The results provide reasonable limits on sample size (200-300 patients), marker number (200-300 in 20-cM intervals), and allele differentiation (loci with allele frequency difference of > or = .3 between admixed parent populations) to produce an efficient approach (> 95\% ascertainment) for locating genes not easily tracked in human pedigrees.},

Here, we present a population genomics study based on direct sequencing of 61 mitotic cell cycle genes from 30 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions and comparison of the resulting data to the close relative Arabidopsis lyrata. We found that the Arabidopsis core cell cycle (CCC) machinery is not highly constrained but is subject to different modes of selection. We found patterns of purifying selection for the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), CDK subunit, retinoblastoma, and WEE1 gene families. Other CCC gene families often showed a mix of one or two constrained genes and relaxed purifying selection on the other genes. We found several large effect mutations in CDKB1;2 that segregate in the species. We found a strong signature of adaptive protein evolution in the Kip-related protein KRP6 and departures from equilibrium at CDKD;1 and CYCA3;3 consistent with the operation of selection in these gene regions. Our data suggest that within Arabidopsis, the genetic robustness of cell cycle-related processes is more due to functional redundancy than high selective constraint.},

  Abstract                 = {Ever since the integration of Mendelian genetics into evolutionary biology in the early 20th century, evolutionary geneticists have for the most part treated genes and mutations as generic entities. However, recent observations indicate that all genes are not equal in the eyes of evolution. Evolutionarily relevant mutations tend to accumulate in hotspot genes and at specific positions within genes. Genetic evolution is constrained by gene function, the structure of genetic networks, and population biology. The genetic basis of evolution may be predictable to some extent, and further understanding of this predictability requires incorporation of the specific functions and characteristics of genes into evolutionary theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Is genetic evolution predictable? Evolutionary developmental biologists have argued that, at least for morphological traits, the answer is a resounding yes. Most mutations causing morphological variation are expected to reside in the cis-regulatory, rather than the coding, regions of developmental genes. This "cis-regulatory hypothesis" has recently come under attack. In this review, we first describe and critique the arguments that have been proposed in support of the cis-regulatory hypothesis. We then test the empirical support for the cis-regulatory hypothesis with a comprehensive survey of mutations responsible for phenotypic evolution in multicellular organisms. Cis-regulatory mutations currently represent approximately 22\% of 331 identified genetic changes although the number of cis-regulatory changes published annually is rapidly increasing. Above the species level, cis-regulatory mutations altering morphology are more common than coding changes. Also, above the species level cis-regulatory mutations predominate for genes not involved in terminal differentiation. These patterns imply that the simple question "Do coding or cis-regulatory mutations cause more phenotypic evolution?" hides more interesting phenomena. Evolution in different kinds of populations and over different durations may result in selection of different kinds of mutations. Predicting the genetic basis of evolution requires a comprehensive synthesis of molecular developmental biology and population genetics.},

  Abstract                 = {Viewed from a geological perspective, present-day animal and plant communities in many parts of the world have a remarkably short history. The environmental revolution at the end of the Pleistocene, a mere 10‚Äà000 years ago, triggered major shifts in the ranges of species and hence composition of communities. Present-day communities in the boreal and temperate zones assembled at this time by combining species that survived the northern environment of the Last Cold Stage with those returning from more temperate refugia. Increasing evidence suggests that the well-studied European southern and eastern refugia for thermophilous animal and plant taxa were supplemented by cryptic refugia in northern Europe during the Late Pleistocene. These northern refugia would have been in areas of sheltered topography that provided suitable stable microclimates, and could partially explain the ‚Äònonanalogue‚Äô mammalian assemblages of the Late Pleistocene. They also have implications for phylogeography and speciation. },

We have demonstrated the utility of the microarray technique in crosses with haploid and diploid embryos by mapping two known mutations to their previously identified locations. We have also used this approach to localize four previously unmapped mutations.

  Abstract                 = {A central challenge in evolutionary biology is to identify genes underlying ecologically important traits and describe the fitness consequences of naturally occurring variation at these loci. To address this goal, several novel approaches have been developed, including 'population genomics,' where a large number of molecular markers are scored in individuals from different environments with the goal of identifying markers showing unusual patterns of variation, potentially due to selection at linked sites. Such approaches are appealing because of (1) the increasing ease of generating large numbers of genetic markers, (2) the ability to scan the genome without measuring phenotypes and (3) the simplicity of sampling individuals without knowledge of their breeding history. Although such approaches are inherently applicable to non-model systems, to date these studies have been limited in their ability to uncover functionally relevant genes. By contrast, quantitative genetics has a rich history, and more recently, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has had some success in identifying genes underlying ecologically relevant variation even in novel systems. QTL mapping, however, requires (1) genetic markers that specifically differentiate parental forms, (2) a focus on a particular measurable phenotype and (3) controlled breeding and maintenance of large numbers of progeny. Here we present current advances and suggest future directions that take advantage of population genomics and quantitative genetic approaches - in both model and non-model systems. Specifically, we discuss advantages and limitations of each method and argue that a combination of the two provides a powerful approach to uncovering the molecular mechanisms responsible for adaptation.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, the advent of high-throughput assays, coupled with their diminishing cost, has facilitated a systems approach to biology. As a consequence, massive amounts of data are currently being generated, requiring efficient methodology aimed at the reduction of scale. Whole-genome transcriptional profiling is a standard component of systems-level analyses, and to reduce scale and improve inference clustering genes is common. Since clustering is often the first step toward generating hypotheses, cluster quality is critical. Conversely, because the validation of cluster-driven hypotheses is indirect, it is critical that quality clusters not be obtained by subjective means. In this paper, we present a new objective-based clustering method and demonstrate that it yields high-quality results. Our method, modulated modularity clustering (MMC), seeks community structure in graphical data. MMC modulates the connection strengths of edges in a weighted graph to maximize an objective function (called modularity) that quantifies community structure. The result of this maximization is a clustering through which tightly-connected groups of vertices emerge. Our application is to systems genetics, and we quantitatively compare MMC both to the hierarchical clustering method most commonly employed and to three popular spectral clustering approaches. We further validate MMC through analyses of human and Drosophila melanogaster expression data, demonstrating that the clusters we obtain are biologically meaningful. We show MMC to be effective and suitable to applications of large scale. In light of these features, we advocate MMC as a standard tool for exploration and hypothesis generation.},

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

  Abstract                 = {The role of past climatic change in shaping the distributions of tropical rain forest vertebrates is central to long-standing hypotheses about the legacy of the Quaternary ice ages. One approach to testing such hypotheses is to use genetic data to infer the demographic history of codistributed species. Population genetic theory that relates the structure of allelic genealogies to historical changes in effective population size can be used to detect a past history of demographic expansion or contraction. The fruit bats Cynopterus sphinx and C. brachyotis (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) exhibit markedly different distribution patterns across the Indomalayan region and therefore represent an exemplary species pair to use for such tests. The purpose of this study was to test alternative hypotheses about historical patterns of demographic expansion and contraction in C. sphinx and C. brachyotis using a coalescent-based analysis of microsatellite variation. Specifically, we used a hierarchical Bayesian model based on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the posterior distribution of genealogical and demographic parameters. The results revealed strong evidence for population contraction in both species. Evidence for a population contraction in C. brachyotis was expected on the basis of biogeographic considerations. However, similar evidence for population contraction in C. sphinx does not support the hypothesis that this species underwent a pronounced range expansion during the late Quaternary. Genetic evidence for population decline may reflect the consequences of habitat destruction on a more recent time scale.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study was to test for evidence that savannah baboons (Papio cynocephalus) underwent a population expansion in concert with a hypothesized expansion of African human and chimpanzee populations during the late Pleistocene. The rationale is that any type of environmental event sufficient to cause simultaneous population expansions in African humans and chimpanzees would also be expected to affect other codistributed mammals. To test for genetic evidence of population expansion or contraction, we performed a coalescent analysis of multilocus microsatellite data using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations were used to estimate the posterior probability density of demographic and genealogical parameters. The model was designed to allow interlocus variation in mutational and demographic parameters, which made it possible to detect aberrant patterns of variation at individual loci that could result from heterogeneity in mutational dynamics or from the effects of selection at linked sites. Results of the MCMC simulations were consistent with zero variance in demographic parameters among loci, but there was evidence for a 10- to 20-fold difference in mutation rate between the most slowly and most rapidly evolving loci. Results of the model provided strong evidence that savannah baboons have undergone a long-term historical decline in population size. The mode of the highest posterior density for the joint distribution of current and ancestral population size indicated a roughly eightfold contraction over the past 1,000 to 250,000 years.

  Abstract                 = {The last 50,000-150,000 years of human history have been characterized by rapid demographic expansions and the colonization of novel environments outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Mass migrations outside the ancestral species range likely entailed many new selection pressures, suggesting that genetic adaptation to local environmental conditions may have been more prevalent in colonizing populations outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Here we report a test of this hypothesis using genome-wide patterns of DNA polymorphism. We conducted a multilocus scan of microsatellite variability to identify regions of the human genome that may have been subject to continent-specific hitchhiking events. Using published polymorphism data for a total of 624 autosomal loci in multiple populations of humans, we used coalescent simulations to identify candidate loci for geographically restricted selective sweeps. We identified a total of 13 loci that appeared as outliers in replicated population comparisons involving different reference samples for Africa. A disproportionate number of these loci exhibited reduced levels of relative variability in non-African populations alone, suggesting that recent episodes of positive selection have been more prevalent outside of sub-Saharan Africa.},

  Abstract                 = {Genome scans have become a common approach to identify genomic signatures of natural selection and reproductive isolation, as well as the genomic bases of ecologically relevant phenotypes, based on patterns of polymorphism and differentiation among populations or species. Here, we review the results of studies taking genome scan approaches in plants, consider the patterns of genomic differentiation documented and their possible causes, discuss the results in light of recent models of genomic differentiation during divergent adaptation and speciation, and consider assumptions and caveats in their interpretation. We find that genomic regions of high divergence generally appear quite small in comparisons of both closely and more distantly related populations, and for the most part, these differentiated regions are spread throughout the genome rather than strongly clustered. Thus, the genome scan approach appears well-suited for identifying genomic regions or even candidate genes that underlie adaptive divergence and/or reproductive barriers. We consider other methodologies that may be used in conjunction with genome scan approaches, and suggest further developments that would be valuable. These include broader use of sequence-based markers of known genomic location, greater attention to sampling strategies to make use of parallel environmental or phenotypic transitions, more integration with approaches such as quantitative trait loci mapping and measures of gene flow across the genome, and additional theoretical and simulation work on processes related to divergent adaptation and speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary Responses of biodiversity to changes in both land cover and climate are recognized [1] but still poorly understood [2]. This poses significant challenges for spatial planning as species could shift, contract, expand, or maintain their¬†range inside or outside protected areas [2‚Äì4]. We¬†examine this problem in Borneo, a global biodiversity¬†hotspot [5],¬†using spatial prioritization analyses that maximize species conservation under multiple environmental-change forecasts. Climate projections indicate that 11%‚Äì36% of Bornean mammal species will lose¬†‚â•30% of their habitat by 2080, and suitable ecological conditions will shift upslope for 23%‚Äì46%. Deforestation exacerbates this process, increasing the proportion of species facing comparable habitat loss to 30%‚Äì49%, a¬†2-fold increase on historical trends. Accommodating these¬†distributional changes will require conserving land outside existing protected areas, but this may be less than anticipated from models incorporating deforestation alone because some species will colonize high-elevation reserves. Our results demonstrate the increasing importance of upland reserves and that relatively small additions (16,000‚Äì28,000¬†km2) to¬†the current conservation estate could provide substantial benefits to biodiversity facing changes to land cover and climate. On Borneo, much of this land is under forestry jurisdiction, warranting targeted conservation partnerships to safeguard biodiversity in an era of global change. },

  Abstract                 = {Natural hybrid zones in forest trees provide systems to study the transfer of adaptive genetic variation by introgression. Previous landscape genomic studies in Populus trichocarpa, a keystone tree species, indicated genomic footprints of admixture with its sister species Populus balsamifera and identified candidate genes for local adaptation. Here, we explored the patterns of introgression and signals of local adaptation in P.¬†trichocarpa and P.¬†balsamifera, employing genome resequencing data from three chromosomes in pure species and admixed individuals from wild populations. Local ancestry analysis in admixed P.¬†trichocarpa revealed a telomeric region in chromosome 15 with P.¬†balsamifera ancestry, containing several candidate genes for local adaptation. Genomic analyses revealed signals of selection in certain genes in this region (e.g. PRR5, COMT1), and functional analyses based on gene expression variation and correlations with adaptive phenotypes suggest distinct functions of the introgressed alleles. In contrast, a block of genes in chromosome 12 paralogous to the introgressed region showed no signs of introgression or signatures of selection. We hypothesize that the introgressed region in chromosome 15 has introduced modular or cassette-like variation into P.¬†trichocarpa. These linked adaptive mutations are associated with a block of genes in chromosome 15 that appear to have undergone neo- or subfunctionalization relative to paralogs in a duplicated region on chromosome 12 that show no signatures of adaptive variation. The association between P.¬†balsamifera introgressed alleles with the expression of adaptive traits in P.¬†trichocarpa supports the hypothesis that this is a case of adaptive introgression in an ecologically important foundation species.},

We identified 4.1 million "singly unique nucleotide" positions informative in distinguishing specific copies and used them to genotype the copy and content of specific paralogs within highly duplicated gene families. These data identify human-specific expansions in genes associated with brain development, reveal extensive population genetic diversity, and detect signatures consistent with gene conversion in the human species.

  Abstract                 = {Studies during the last 20 years have shown that the chromosomes of many organisms, especially those of higher vertebrates, consist of a series of segments having different properties. These can be recognized as, for example, G- and R-bands. Recent studies have indicated that genes tend to lie in the R-bands rather than in the G-bands, although the number of genes that has been mapped with high precision is, as yet, only a very small proportion of the total, probably much less than 1\%. We have therefore sought to study the distribution of genes on chromosomes using a cytological approach in conjunction with "universal" markers for genes. Such markers include mRNA and the gene-rich, G+C-rich H3 fraction of DNA, both of which can be localized using in situ hybridization, and DNase I hypersensitivity, and digestion by restriction enzymes known to show selectivity for the CpG islands associated with active genes, both of which can be detected using in situ nick translation. We have chosen to use the approaches involving in situ nick translation and have shown that the patterns of DNase I hypersensitivity and of CpG islands on human chromosomes show a strict correspondence to R-banding patterns: Deviations from R-banding patterns reported by previous investigators who have made similar studies appear to be attributable to excessive digestion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) constitutes a class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. ABC has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).},

  Abstract                 = {Resource competition is thought to play a major role in driving evolutionary diversification. For instance, in ecological character displacement, coexisting species evolve to use different resources, reducing the effects of interspecific competition. It is thought that a similar diversifying effect might occur in response to competition among members of a single species. Individuals may mitigate the effects of intraspecific competition by switching to use alternative resources not used by conspecific competitors. This diversification is the driving force in some models of sympatric speciation, but has not been demonstrated in natural populations. Here, we present experimental evidence confirming that competition drives ecological diversification within natural populations. We manipulated population density of three-spine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in enclosures in a natural lake. Increased population density led to reduced prey availability, causing individuals to add alternative prey types to their diet. Since phenotypically different individuals added different alternative prey, diet variation among individuals increased relative to low-density control enclosures. Competition also increased the diet-morphology correlations, so that the frequency-dependent interactions were stronger in high competition. These results not only confirm that resource competition promotes niche variation within populations, but also show that this increased diversity can arise via behavioural plasticity alone, without the evolutionary changes commonly assumed by theory.},

  Abstract                 = {
* 1The Pleistocene is an important period for assessing the impact of climate change on biodiversity. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21¬†000 years ago), large glaciers and permafrost reached far south in Europe. Trees are traditionally thought to have survived only in scattered Mediterranean refugia (southern refugia hypothesis), but a recent proposal suggests that trees may have been much more widely and northerly distributed (northern refugia hypothesis).
* 2In this study, the southern vs. northern refugia hypotheses were investigated by estimating the potential LGM distributions of 7 boreal and 15 nemoral widespread European tree species using species distribution modelling. The models were calibrated using data for modern species distributions and climate and projected onto two LGM climate simulations for Europe. Five modelling variants were implemented.
* 3Models with moderate to good predictive ability for current species range limits and species richness patterns were developed.
* 4Broadly consistent results were obtained irrespective of the climate simulation and modelling variant used. Our results indicate that LGM climatic conditions suitable for boreal species existed across Central and Eastern Europe and into the Russian Plain. In contrast, suitable climatic conditions for nemoral tree species were largely restricted to the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions. Large proportions of these northern and southern regions would have been suitable for a number of boreal or boreal plus nemoral tree species, respectively.
* 5These findings are consistent with recent palaeoecological and phylogeographic data regarding LGM distributions of trees and other boreal and nemoral taxa.
* 6Synthesis. It is clear that the view of the LGM landscape in Europe as largely treeless, especially north of the Alps, needs to be revised. Trees were probably much more widespread during the LGM than hitherto thought, although patchily distributed at low densities due to low atmospheric CO2 concentrations and high wind-speeds. The findings presented here help explain the occurrence of mammal assemblages with mixtures of forest, tundra and steppe species at many localities in southern Central and Eastern Europe during the LGM, as well as the phylogeographic evidence for the extra-Mediterranean persistence of many boreal species.},

  Abstract                 = {Learning and other forms of phenotypic plasticity have been suggested to enhance population divergence. Mate preferences can develop by learning, and species recognition might not be entirely genetic. We present data on female mate preferences of the banded demoiselle (Calopteryx splendens) that suggest a role for learning in population divergence and species recognition. Populations of this species are either allopatric or sympatric with a phenotypically similar congener (C. virgo). These two species differ mainly in the amount of wing melanization in males, and wing patches thus mediate sexual isolation. In sympatry, sexually experienced females discriminate against large melanin wing patches in heterospecific males. In contrast, in allopatric populations within the same geographic region, females show positive ("open-ended") preferences for such large wing patches. Virgin C. splendens females do not discriminate against heterospecific males. Moreover, physical exposure experiments of such virgin females to con- or hetero-specific males significantly influences their subsequent mate preferences. Species recognition is thus not entirely genetic and it is partly influenced by interactions with mates. Learning causes pronounced population divergence in mate preferences between these weakly genetically differentiated populations, and results in a highly divergent pattern of species recognition at a small geographic scale.},

  Abstract                 = {The fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata differ extensively in biochemistry, morphology, and behavior. We use a survey of five diagnostic enzyme loci across the hybrid zone near Cracow in Southern Poland to estimate the dispersal rate, selection pressures, and numbers of loci which maintain this zone. The enzyme clines coincide closely with each other and with morphological and mitochondrial DNA clines. Although the zone lies on a broad transition between environments suitable for bombina and variegata, the close concordance of diverse characters, together with increased aberrations and mortality in hybrids, suggest that the zone is maintained largely by selection against hybrids. There are strong "linkage disequilibria" between each pair of (unlinked) enzyme loci (RÌ = 0.129 [2-unit support limits: 0.119-0.139]). These are probably caused by gene flow into the zone, and they give an estimate of dispersal (Ï = 890 [790-940] m gen-1/2). The clines are sharply stepped, with most of the change occurring within 6.15 (5.45-6.45) km, but with long tails of introgression on either side. This implies that the effective selection pressure on each enzyme marker (due largely to disequilibrium with other loci) is s* = 0.17 (0.159-0.181) at the center but that the selection acting directly on the enzyme loci is weak or zero (se < 0.0038). The stepped pattern implies a barrier to gene flow of 220 (48-415) km. This would substantially delay neutral introgression but would have little effect on advantageous alleles; the two taxa need not evolve independently. Strong selection is needed to maintain such a barrier: hybrid populations must have their mean fitness reduced by a factor of 0.65 (0.60-0.77). This selection must be spread over a large number of loci to account for the concordant patterns and the observed cline widths (N = 300 [80-2,000]).},

Comparisons are made to other insects for which the same regions are completely sequenced. Percentage A + T is found to be relatively low in C. parallelus though consistent with that of the other Orthopteran, Locusta migratoria. The relative number of substitutions observed in the different protein-coding genes was analysed between pairs of insect species sharing different levels of relatedness. A clear change in this rate was observed between the within-genus and between-genera comparisons. This change is interpreted in terms of the functional constraints acting on these four different genes. The patterns seem to result from an early saturation of COI and COII genes with synonymous substitutions, and a tolerance of ND2 and ATPase8 function to high levels of amino acid replacements. This analysis highlights a need for further sequence studies and comparisons between taxa of different levels of divergence in order to understand the patterns of mtDNA evolution on which many evolutionary investigations are based.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the patterns and processes underlying the uneven distribution of biodiversity across space and time constitutes a major scientific challenge in evolutionary biology. With rapidly accumulating species occurrence data, there is an increasing ne ed for making the process of coding species into operational units for biogeographic and evolutionary analyses faster, automated, transparent and reproducible. Here we present SpeciesGeoCoder, a free software package written in Python and R, that allows fo r easy coding of species into user-defined areas. These areas may be of any size and be purely geographical (i.e., polygons) such as political units, conservation areas, biomes, islands, biodiversity hotspots, and areas of endemism, but may also include al titudinal ranges. This flexibility allows scoring species into complex categories, such as those encountered in topographically and ecologically heterogeneous landscapes. In addition, SpeciesGeoCoder can be used to facilitate sorting and cleaning of occurr ence data. The various outputs of SpeciesGeoCoder include quantitative biodiversity statistics, global and local distribution maps, and NEXUS files that can be directly used in many phylogeny-based applications for ancestral state reconstruction, investiga tions on biome evolution, and diversification rate analyses. Our simulations indicate that even datasets containing hundreds of millions of records can be analysed in relatively short time using a regular desktop computer. We exemplify the use of our progr am through two contrasting examples: i) inferring historical dispersal of birds across the Isthmus of Panama, separating lowland vs. montane species and optimising the results onto a species-level, dated phylogeny; and ii) exploring seasonal variations in the occurrence of 10 GPS-tracked individuals of moose (Alces alces) over one year in northern Sweden. These analyses show that SpeciesGeoCoder allows an easy, flexible and fast categorisation of species distribution data for various analyses in ecology and evolution, with potential use at different spatial, taxonomic and temporal scales.},

  Abstract                 = {Virtually all empirical ecological studies require species identification during data collection. DNA metabarcoding refers to the automated identification of multiple species from a single bulk sample containing entire organisms or from a single environmental sample containing degraded DNA (soil, water, faeces, etc.). It can be implemented for both modern and ancient environmental samples. The availability of next-generation sequencing platforms and the ecologists‚Äô need for high-throughput taxon identification have facilitated the emergence of DNA metabarcoding. The potential power of DNA metabarcoding as it is implemented today is limited mainly by its dependency on PCR and by the considerable investment needed to build comprehensive taxonomic reference libraries. Further developments associated with the impressive progress in DNA sequencing will eliminate the currently required DNA amplification step, and comprehensive taxonomic reference libraries composed of whole organellar genomes and repetitive ribosomal nuclear DNA can be built based on the well-curated DNA extract collections maintained by standardized barcoding initiatives. The near-term future of DNA metabarcoding has an enormous potential to boost data acquisition in biodiversity research.},

  Abstract                 = {The Quaternary cold periods in Europe are thought to have heavily influenced the amount and distribution of intraspecific genetic variation in both animals and plants. The phylogeographies of 10 taxa, including mammals (Ursus arctos, Sorex spp., Crocidura suaveolens, Arvicola spp.), amphibians (Triturus spp.), arthropods (Chorthippus parallelus), and plants (Abies alba, Picea abies, Fagus sylvatica, Quercus spp.), were analysed to elucidate general trends across Europe. Only a small degree of congruence was found amongst the phylogeographies of the 10 taxa, but the likely postglacial colonization routes exhibit some similarities. A Brooks parsimony analysis produced an unrooted area phylogram, showing that: (i) the northern regions were colonized generally from the Iberic and Balkanic refugia; and (ii) the Italian lineages were often isolated due to the presence of the Alpine barrier. The comparison of colonization routes highlighted four main suture-zones where lineages from the different refugia meet. Some of the intraspecific genetic distances among lineages indicated a prequaternary divergence that cannot be connected to any particular cold period, but are probably related mainly to the date of arrival of each taxon in the European continent. As a consequence, molecular genetics so far appears to be of limited use in dating Quaternary events.},

  Abstract                 = {A genome scan for the signatures of selection for paralogous functional amino acid differences were performed with yeast genomes. This recently developed method makes it possible to localize the target site(s) of selection. We found that two gene pairs have strong signatures of selection. The two pairs of duplicated genes happened to be heat shock genes (Ssa1/Ssa2 and Ssb1/Ssb2), which have similar protein structures to each other while the amino acid sequence identity between Ssa and Ssb is not high ( approximately 60\%). Interestingly, the two gene pairs exhibit signature of selection at almost identical positions within the substrate-binding domain-beta. Because this domain specifies the substrate polypeptides, it is presumed that functional divergence may be advantageous in this domain. Evolutionary analysis demonstrated that the observed divergence in the two gene pairs have been maintained in many yeast species independently, suggesting long-term operation of strong selection.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe and evaluate a new estimator of the effective population size (N(e)), a critical parameter in evolutionary and conservation biology. This new "SummStat" N(e) estimator is based upon the use of summary statistics in an approximate Bayesian computation framework to infer N(e). Simulations of a Wright-Fisher population with known N(e) show that the SummStat estimator is useful across a realistic range of individuals and loci sampled, generations between samples, and N(e) values. We also address the paucity of information about the relative performance of N(e) estimators by comparing the SummStat estimator to two recently developed likelihood-based estimators and a traditional moment-based estimator. The SummStat estimator is the least biased of the four estimators compared. In 32 of 36 parameter combinations investigated using initial allele frequencies drawn from a Dirichlet distribution, it has the lowest bias. The relative mean square error (RMSE) of the SummStat estimator was generally intermediate to the others. All of the estimators had RMSE > 1 when small samples (n = 20, five loci) were collected a generation apart. In contrast, when samples were separated by three or more generations and N(e) < or = 50, the SummStat and likelihood-based estimators all had greatly reduced RMSE. Under the conditions simulated, SummStat confidence intervals were more conservative than the likelihood-based estimators and more likely to include true N(e). The greatest strength of the SummStat estimator is its flexible structure. This flexibility allows it to incorporate any potentially informative summary statistic from population genetic data.},

This version also contains enhanced algorithms to search for the optimal trees under evolutionary criteria and implements a more advanced memory management that can double the size of sequence data sets to which MEGA can be applied.

Nup160 encodes a nuclear pore complex protein and shows evidence of adaptive evolution. Furthermore, the protein encoded by Nup160 directly interacts with that of another hybrid lethality gene, Nup96, indicating that at least two lethal hybrid incompatibility genes have evolved as byproducts of divergent coevolution among interacting components of the Drosophila nuclear pore complex.},

  Abstract                 = {Current major barriers for using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in genetic mutation screening on an epidemiological scale appear to be the high accuracy demanded by clinical applications and high per-sample cost. How to achieve high efficiency in enriching targeted disease genes while keeping a low cost/sample is a key technical hurdle to overcome. We validated a cDNA-probe-based approach for capturing exons of a group of genes known to cause deafness. Polymerase chain reaction amplicons were made from cDNA clones of the targeted genes and used as bait probes in hybridization for capturing human genomic DNA (gDNA) fragments. The cDNA library containing the clones of targeted genes provided a readily available, low-cost, and regenerable source for producing capture probes with standard molecular biology equipment. Captured gDNA fragments by our method were sequenced by the Illumina NGS platform. Results demonstrated that targeted exons captured by our approach achieved specificity, multiplexicity, uniformity, and depth of coverage suitable for accurate sequencing applications by the NGS systems. Reliable genotype calls for various homozygous and heterozygous mutations were achieved. The results were confirmed independently by conventional Sanger sequencing. The method validated here could be readily expanded to include all-known deafness genes for applications such as genetic hearing screening in newborns. The high coverage depth and cost benefits of the cDNA-probe-based exon capture approach may also facilitate widespread applications in clinical practices beyond screening mutations in deafness genes.},

  Abstract                 = {A recently developed PCR-based assay, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), has been used for assessing phylogenetic relationships and the genetic structure of populations in many organisms including insects. Preliminary studies show that the procedure does not work well in acridid grasshoppers since it leads to very large numbers of indistinct bands, probably due to the large size of the genome. To overcome this drawback, we developed long primer sets with four selective nucleotides, and used these for the grasshoppers Chorthippus brunneus and C. jacobsi in northern Spain. This approach has allowed us to reduce the number of bands, so that we can compare homologous bands easily. Using the revised method, it appears that the degree of interspecific genetic differentiation of C. brunneus and C. jacobsi is relatively small.},

  Abstract                 = {Genotype imputation has become a standard option for researchers to expand their genotype datasets to improve signal precision and power in tests of genetic association with disease. In imputations for family-based studies however, subjects are often treated as unrelated individuals: currently, only BEAGLE allows for simultaneous imputation for trios of parents and offspring; however, only the most likely genotype calls are returned, not estimated genotype probabilities. For population-based SNP association studies, it has been shown that incorporating genotype uncertainty can be more powerful than using hard genotype calls. We here investigate this issue in the context of case-parent family data. We present the statistical framework for the genotypic transmission-disequilibrium test (gTDT) using observed genotype calls and imputed genotype probabilities, derive an extension to assess gene-environment interactions for binary environmental variables, and illustrate the performance of our method on a set of trios from the International Cleft Consortium. In contrast to population-based studies, however, utilizing the genotype probabilities in this framework (derived by treating the family members as unrelated) can result in biases of the test statistics toward protectiveness for the minor allele, particularly for markers with lower minor allele frequencies and lower imputation quality. We further compare the results between ignoring relatedness in the imputation and taking family structure into account, based on hard genotype calls. We find that by far the least biased results are obtained when family structure is taken into account and currently recommend this approach in spite of its intense computational requirements.},

These methods are easy to implement, and, since explicit formulae tend to be either unavailable or unilluminating, they are also more useful and more informative in most applications. Extensions are presented that allow for the effects of uncertainty in our knowledge of population size and mutation rates, for variability in population sizes, for regions of different mutation rate, and for inference concerning the coalescence time of the entire population.

  Abstract                 = {Hybrid zones between closely related species or subspecies provide useful settings for studying the genetic architecture of speciation. Using markers distributed throughout the mouse genome, we use a hybrid zone between two recently diverged species of house mice (Mus musculus and Mus domesticus) as a natural mapping experiment to identify genomic regions that may be involved in reproductive isolation. Using cline analysis we document a nearly 50-fold variation in level of introgression among markers. Some markers have extremely narrow cline widths; these genomic regions may contribute to reproductive isolation. Biological processes associated with these narrow clines include physiological and immune responses to the environment as well as physiological and behavioral aspects of reproduction. Other autosomal markers exhibit asymmetrically broad clines, usually with high frequencies of M. domesticus alleles on the M. musculus side of the hybrid zone. These markers identify genome regions likely housing genes with alleles that are spreading from one species to the other. Biological processes associated with these wide clines include cell signaling, olfaction, and pheromone response. These processes play important roles in survival and reproduction, and associated genes are likely targets of selection. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium in the center of the hybrid zone suggest that isolation may be caused by multiple epistatic interactions between sets of genes. These data highlight the complex genetic architecture underlying speciation even at early stages of divergence and point to some of the biological processes that may govern this architecture.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies of the genetics of hybrid zones can provide insight into the genomic architecture of species boundaries. By examining patterns of introgression of multiple loci across a hybrid zone, it may be possible to identify regions of the genome that have experienced selection. Here, we present a comparison of introgression in two replicate transects through the house mouse hybrid zone through central Europe, using data from 41 single nucleotide markers. Using both genomic and geographic clines, we found many differences in patterns of introgression between the two transects, as well as some similarities. We found that many loci may have experienced the effects of selection at linked sites, including selection against hybrid genotypes, as well as positive selection in the form of genotypes introgressed into a foreign genetic background. We also found many positive associations of conspecific alleles among unlinked markers, which could be caused by epistatic interactions. Different patterns of introgression in the two transects highlight the challenge of using hybrid zones to identify genes underlying isolation and raise the possibility that the genetic basis of isolation between these species may be dependent on the local population genetic make-up or the local ecological setting. },

  Abstract                 = {Genetic incompatibilities are supposed to play an important role in speciation. A general (theoretical) problem is to explain the persistence of genetic diversity after secondary contact. Previous theoretical work has pointed out that Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMI) are not stable in the face of migration unless local selection acts on the alleles involved in incompatibility. With local selection, genetic variability exists up to a critical migration rate but is lost when migration exceeds this threshold value. Here, we investigate the effect of intracellular bacteria Wolbachia on the stability of hybrid zones formed after the Dobzhansky Muller model. Wolbachia are known to cause a cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) within and between species. Incorporating intracellular bacteria Wolbachia can lead to a significant increase of critical migration rates and maintenance of divergence, primarily because Wolbachia-induced incompatibility acts to reduce frequencies of F1 hybrids. Wolbachia infect up to two-thirds of all insect species and it is therefore likely that CI co-occurs with DMI in nature. The results indicate that both isolating mechanisms strengthen each other and under some circumstances act synergistically. Thus they can drive speciation processes more forcefully than either when acting alone.},

  Abstract                 = {A founder event occurs when a new population is established from a small number of individuals drawn from a large ancestral population. Mayr proposed that genetic drift in an isolated founder population could alter the selective forces in an epistatic system, an observation supported by recent studies. Carson argued that a period of relaxed selection could occur when a founder population is in an open ecological niche, allowing rapid population growth after the founder event. Selectable genetic variation can actually increase during this founder-flush phase due to recombination, enhanced survival of advantageous mutations, and the conversion of non-additive genetic variance into additive variance in an epistatic system, another empirically confirmed prediction. Templeton combined the theories of Mayr and Carson with population genetic models to predict the conditions under which founder events can contribute to speciation, and these predictions are strongly confirmed by the empirical literature. Much of the criticism of founder speciation is based upon equating founder speciation to an adaptive peak shift opposed by selection. However, Mayr, Carson and Templeton all modeled a positive interaction of selection and drift, and Templeton showed that founder speciation is incompatible with peak-shift conditions. Although rare, founder speciation can have a disproportionate importance in adaptive innovation and radiation, and examples are given to show that "rare" does not mean "unimportant" in evolution. Founder speciation also interacts with other speciation mechanisms such that a speciation event is not a one-dimensional process due to either selection alone or drift alone.},

This variation extends to other species in the genus Zea: although maize and Zea luxurians diverged only ∼140,000 years ago, their genomes differ in size by ∼50%. We used paired-end Illumina sequencing to evaluate the potential contribution of TEs to the genome size difference between these two species. We aligned the reads both to a filtered gene set and to an exemplar database of unique repeats representing 1514 TE families; ∼85% of reads mapped against TE repeats in both species. The relative contribution of TE families to the B73 genome was highly correlated with previous estimates, suggesting that reliable estimates of TE content can be obtained from short high-throughput sequencing reads, even at low coverage. Because we used paired-end reads, we could assess whether a TE was near a gene by determining if one paired read mapped to a TE and the second read mapped to a gene. Using this method, Class 2 DNA elements were found significantly more often in genic regions than Class 1 RNA elements, but Class 1 elements were found more often near other TEs. Overall, we found that both Class1 and 2 TE families account for ∼70% of the genome size difference between B73 and luxurians. Interestingly, the relative abundance of TE families was conserved between species (r=0.97), suggesting genome-wide control of TE content rather than family-specific effects.},

Here we present SMC++, a new statistical tool capable of analyzing orders of magnitude more samples than existing methods while requiring only unphased genomes (its results are independent of phasing). SMC++ can jointly infer population size histories and split times in diverged populations, and it employs a novel spline regularization scheme that greatly reduces estimation error. We apply SMC++ to analyze sequence data from over a thousand human genomes in Africa and Eurasia, hundreds of genomes from a Drosophila melanogaster population in Africa, and tens of genomes from zebra finch and long-tailed finch populations in Australia.},

  Abstract                 = {The sample frequency spectrum (SFS) of DNA sequences from a collection of individuals is a summary statistic that is commonly used for parametric inference in population genetics. Despite the popularity of SFS-based inference methods, little is currently known about the information theoretic limit on the estimation accuracy as a function of sample size. Here, we show that using the SFS to estimate the size history of a population has a minimax error of at least O(1/log s), where s is the number of independent segregating sites used in the analysis. This rate is exponentially worse than known convergence rates for many classical estimation problems in statistics. Another surprising aspect of our theoretical bound is that it does not depend on the dimension of the SFS, which is related to the number of sampled individuals. This means that, for a fixed number s of segregating sites considered, using more individuals does not help to reduce the minimax error bound. Our result pertains to populations that have experienced a bottleneck, and we argue that it can be expected to apply to many populations in nature.},

  Abstract                 = {The beneficial substitution of an allele shapes patterns of genetic variation at linked sites. Thus, in principle, adaptations can be mapped by looking for the signature of directional selection in polymorphism data. In practice, such efforts are hampered by the need for an accurate characterization of the demographic history of the species and of the effects of positive selection. In an attempt to circumvent these difficulties, researchers are increasingly taking a purely empirical approach, in which a large number of genomic regions are ordered by summaries of the polymorphism data, and loci with extreme values are considered to be likely targets of positive selection. We evaluated the reliability of the "empirical" approach, focusing on applications to human data and to maize. To do so, we considered a coalescent model of directional selection in a sensible demographic setting, allowing for selection on standing variation as well as on a new mutation. Our simulations suggest that while empirical approaches will identify several interesting candidates, they will also miss many--in some cases, most--loci of interest. The extent of the trade-off depends on the mode of positive selection and the demographic history of the population. Specifically, the false-discovery rate is higher when directional selection involves a recessive rather than a co-dominant allele, when it acts on a previously neutral rather than a new allele, and when the population has experienced a population bottleneck rather than maintained a constant size. One implication of these results is that, insofar as attributes of the beneficial mutation (e.g., the dominance coefficient) affect the power to detect targets of selection, genomic scans will yield an unrepresentative subset of loci that contribute to adaptations.},

We specifically test for the conditions under which divergent natural selection can cause a 'generalized barrier to gene flow' that is present across the genome. Our individual-based numerical simulations focus on how population divergence at neutral loci varies in relation to recombination rate with a selected locus, divergent selection on that locus, migration rate and population size. We specifically test whether genetic differences at neutral markers are greater between populations in different environments than between populations in similar environments. We find that this expected signature of ecological speciation can be detected under part of the parameter space, most consistently when divergent selection is strong and migration is intermediate. By contrast, the expected signature of ecological speciation is not reliably detected when divergent selection is weak or migration is low or high. These findings provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of using neutral markers to infer ecological speciation in natural systems.},

We estimate a recent bottleneck 0.006N(e) generations ago, somewhat further in the past than suggested by biogeographical evidence. Using various proposed statistical tests, we find that this bottleneck model is able to predict the majority of observed features of diversity and linkage disequilibrium in the data. Thus, while precise estimates of bottleneck parameters (like inferences of selection) are sensitive to model assumptions, our results imply that it may be unnecessary to invoke frequent selective sweeps associated with the dispersal of D. melanogaster from Africa to explain patterns of variability in non-African populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent data from Drosophila suggest that a substantial fraction of amino acid substitutions observed between species are beneficial. If these beneficial mutations are on average partially recessive, then the rate of protein evolution is predicted to be faster for X-linked genes compared to autosomal genes (the "faster-X" hypothesis). We test this prediction by comparing rates of protein substitutions between orthologous genes, taking advantage of variations in chromosome fusions within the genus Drosophila. In members of the Drosophila melanogaster species group, the chromosomal arm 3L segregates as an ordinary autosome (i.e., two homologous copies in both males and females). However, in the Drosophila pseudoobscura species group, this chromosomal arm has become fused to the ancestral X chromosome and is hemizygous in males. The faster-X hypothesis predicts that protein evolution should be faster for genes on this chromosomal arm in the D. pseudoobscura lineage, relative to the D. melanogaster lineage. Here we combine new sequence data for 202 gene fragments in Drosophila miranda (in the pseudoobscura species group) with the completed genomes of D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, and Drosophila yakuba to show that there are no detectable differences in rates of amino acid evolution for orthologous X-linked and autosomal genes. Our results imply that the contribution of the faster-X (if any) to the large-X effect on reproductive isolation in Drosophila is not due to a generally faster rate of protein evolution. The lack of a detectable faster-X effect in these species suggests either that beneficial amino acids are not partially recessive on average, or that adaptive evolution does not often use newly arising amino acid mutations.},

We compiled statistics of annual demersal fish landings from bottom trawl catches landing in England and Wales dating back to 1889, using previously neglected UK Government data. We then corrected the figures for increases in fishing power over time and a recent shift in the proportion of fish landed abroad to estimate the change in landings per unit of fishing power (LPUP), a measure of the commercial productivity of fisheries. LPUP reduced by 94\%-17-fold--over the past 118 years.

  Abstract                 = {The Firth of Clyde is a large inlet of the sea that extends over 100 km into Scotland's west coast.We compiled detailed fisheries landings data for this area and combined them with historical accounts to build a picture of change due to fishing activity over the last 200 years.In the early 19th century, prior to the onset of industrial fishing, the Firth of Clyde supported diverse and productive fisheries for species such as herring (Clupea harengus, Clupeidae), cod (Gadus morhua, Gadidae), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus, Gadidae), turbot (Psetta maxima, Scophthalmidae) and flounder (Platichthys flesus, Pleuronectidae). The 19th century saw increased demand for fish, which encouraged more indiscriminate methods of fishing such as bottom trawling. During the 1880s, fish landings began to decline, and upon the recommendation of local fishers and scientists, the Firth of Clyde was closed to large trawling vessels in 1889. This closure remained in place until 1962 when bottom trawling for Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus, Nephropidae) was approved in areas more than three nautical miles from the coast. During the 1960s and 1970s, landings of bottomfish increased as trawling intensified. The trawl closure within three nautical miles of the coast was repealed in 1984 under pressure from the industry. Thereafter, bottomfish landings went into terminal decline, with all species collapsing to zero or near zero landings by the early 21st century. Herring fisheries collapsed in the 1970s as more efficient mid-water trawls and fish finders were introduced, while a fishery for mid-water saithe (Pollachius virens, Gadidae) underwent a boom and bust shortly after discovery in the late 1960s. The only commercial fisheries that remain today are for Nephrops and scallops (Pecten maximus, Pectinidae).The Firth of Clyde is a marine ecosystem nearing the endpoint of overfishing, a time when no species remain that are capable of sustaining commercial catches. The evidence suggests that trawl closures helped maintain productive fisheries through the mid-20th century, and their reopening precipitated collapse of bottomfish stocks. We argue that continued intensive bottom trawling for Nephrops with fine mesh nets will prevent the recovery of other species. This once diverse and highly productive environment will only be restored if trawl closures or other protected areas are re-introduced. The Firth of Clyde represents at a small scale a process that is occurring ocean-wide today, and its experience serves as a warning to others.},

  Abstract                 = {Sequencing a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using a nanopore is a revolutionary concept because it combines the potential for long read lengths (>5 kbp) with high speed (1 bp/10 ns), while obviating the need for costly amplification procedures due to the exquisite single molecule sensitivity. The prospects for implementing this concept seem bright. The cost savings from the removal of required reagents, coupled with the speed of nanopore sequencing places the \$1000 genome within grasp. However, challenges remain: high fidelity reads demand stringent control over both the molecular configuration in the pore and the translocation kinetics. The molecular configuration determines how the ions passing through the pore come into contact with the nucleotides, while the translocation kinetics affect the time interval in which the same nucleotides are held in the constriction as the data is acquired. Proteins like ?-hemolysin and its mutants offer exquisitely precise self-assembled nanopores and have demonstrated the facility for discriminating individual nucleotides, but it is currently difficult to design protein structure ab initio, which frustrates tailoring a pore for sequencing genomic DNA. Nanopores in solid-state membranes have been proposed as an alternative because of the flexibility in fabrication and ease of integration into a sequencing platform. Preliminary results have shown that with careful control of the dimensions of the pore and the shape of the electric field, control of DNA translocation through the pore is possible. Furthermore, discrimination between different base pairs of DNA may be feasible. Thus, a nanopore promises inexpensive, reliable, high-throughput sequencing, which could thrust genomic science into personal medicine.},

  Abstract                 = {RAD-tag is a powerful tool for high-throughput genotyping. It relies on PCR amplification of the starting material, following enzymatic digestion and sequencing adaptor ligation. Amplification introduces duplicate reads into the data, which arise from the same template molecule and are statistically nonindependent, potentially introducing errors into genotype calling. In shotgun sequencing, data duplicates are removed by filtering reads starting at the same position in the alignment. However, restriction enzymes target specific locations within the genome, causing reads to start in the same place, and making it difficult to estimate the extent of PCR duplication. Here, we introduce a slight change to the Illumina sequencing adaptor chemistry, appending a unique four-base tag to the first index read, which allows duplicate discrimination in aligned data. This approach was validated on the Illumina MiSeq platform, using double-digest libraries of ants (Wasmannia auropunctata) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) with known genotypes, producing modest though statistically significant gains in the odds of calling a genotype accurately. More importantly, removing duplicates also corrected for strong sample-to-sample variability of genotype calling accuracy seen in the ant samples. For libraries prepared from low-input degraded museum bird samples (Mixornis gularis), which had low complexity, having been generated from relatively few starting molecules, adaptor tags show that virtually all of the genotypes were called with inflated confidence as a result of PCR duplicates. Quantification of library complexity by adaptor tagging does not significantly increase the difficulty of the overall workflow or its cost, but corrects for differences in quality between samples and permits analysis of low-input material.},

This species is subdivided into two naturally hybridizing lineages, one inhabiting the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean and the other the Mediterranean and Black seas. Here we provide a high-quality chromosome-scale assembly of its genome that shows a high degree of synteny with the more highly derived teleosts. We find expansions of gene families specifically associated with ion and water regulation, highlighting adaptation to variation in salinity. We further generate a genome-wide variation map through RAD-sequencing of Atlantic and Mediterranean populations. We show that variation in local recombination rates strongly influences the genomic landscape of diversity within and differentiation between lineages. Comparing predictions of alternative demographic models to the joint allele-frequency spectrum indicates that genomic islands of differentiation between sea bass lineages were generated by varying rates of introgression across the genome following a period of geographical isolation.},

  Abstract                 = {Deep shotgun sequencing and analysis of genomes, transcriptomes, amplified single-cell genomes, and metagenomes has enabled investigation of a wide range of organisms and ecosystems. However, sampling variation in short-read data sets and high sequencing error rates of modern sequencers present many new computational challenges in data interpretation. These challenges have led to the development of new classes of mapping tools and {\em de novo} assemblers. These algorithms are challenged by the continued improvement in sequencing throughput. We here describe digital normalization, a single-pass computational algorithm that systematizes coverage in shotgun sequencing data sets, thereby decreasing sampling variation, discarding redundant data, and removing the majority of errors. Digital normalization substantially reduces the size of shotgun data sets and decreases the memory and time requirements for {\em de novo} sequence assembly, all without significantly impacting content of the generated contigs. We apply digital normalization to the assembly of microbial genomic data, amplified single-cell genomic data, and transcriptomic data.

  Abstract                 = {Discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA has been noted in many systems. Asymmetric introgression of mitochondria is a common cause of such discordances, although in most cases the drivers of introgression are unknown. In the yellow-rumped warbler, evidence suggests that mtDNA from the eastern, myrtle warbler, has introgressed across much of the range of the western form, the Audubon's warbler. Within the southwestern United States myrtle mtDNA comes into contact with another clade that occurs in the Mexican black-fronted warbler. Both northern forms exhibit seasonal migration, whereas black-fronted warblers are nonmigratory. We investigated the link between mitochondrial introgression, mitochondrial function, and migration using novel genetic, isotopic, biochemical, and phenotypic data obtained from populations in the transition zone. Isotopes suggest the zone is coincident with a shift in migration, with individuals in the south being resident and populations further north becoming increasingly more migratory. Mitochondrial respiration in flight muscles demonstrates that myrtle-type individuals have a significantly greater acceptor control ratio of mitochondria, suggesting it may be more metabolically efficient. To our knowledge this is the first time this type of intraspecific variation in mitochondrial respiration has been measured in wild birds and we discuss how such mitochondrial adaptations may have facilitated introgression.},

This simplification opens RADseq to any lab with the ability to extract DNA and perform a restriction digest. ezRAD also differs from others in its flexibility to use any restriction enzyme (or combination of enzymes) that cuts frequently enough to generate fragments of the desired size range, without requiring the purchase of separate adapters for each enzyme or a sonication step, which can further decrease the cost involved in choosing optimal enzymes for particular species and research questions. We apply this method across a wide taxonomic diversity of non-model organisms to demonstrate the utility and flexibility of our approach. The simplicity of ezRAD makes it particularly useful for the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms and targeted amplicon sequencing in natural populations of non-model organisms that have been historically understudied because of lack of genomic information.},

  Abstract                 = {The Escherichia coli species represents one of the best-studied model organisms, but also encompasses a variety of commensal and pathogenic strains that diversify by high rates of genetic change. We uniformly (re-) annotated the genomes of 20 commensal and pathogenic E. coli strains and one strain of E. fergusonii (the closest E. coli related species), including seven that we sequenced to completion. Within the approximately 18,000 families of orthologous genes, we found approximately 2,000 common to all strains. Although recombination rates are much higher than mutation rates, we show, both theoretically and using phylogenetic inference, that this does not obscure the phylogenetic signal, which places the B2 phylogenetic group and one group D strain at the basal position. Based on this phylogeny, we inferred past evolutionary events of gain and loss of genes, identifying functional classes under opposite selection pressures. We found an important adaptive role for metabolism diversification within group B2 and Shigella strains, but identified few or no extraintestinal virulence-specific genes, which could render difficult the development of a vaccine against extraintestinal infections. Genome flux in E. coli is confined to a small number of conserved positions in the chromosome, which most often are not associated with integrases or tRNA genes. Core genes flanking some of these regions show higher rates of recombination, suggesting that a gene, once acquired by a strain, spreads within the species by homologous recombination at the flanking genes. Finally, the genome's long-scale structure of recombination indicates lower recombination rates, but not higher mutation rates, at the terminus of replication. The ensuing effect of background selection and biased gene conversion may thus explain why this region is A+T-rich and shows high sequence divergence but low sequence polymorphism. Overall, despite a very high gene flow, genes co-exist in an organised genome.},

This revealed considerable differences between the sexes and between populations and differences in the pattern of sexual dimorphism between populations. The presence of sexual dimorphism and the extent of differences between populations suggests that divergence has been driven by sexual selection acting through a contact pheromone on the cuticle. However, those lipids that differ most between the sexes are not the same as those that vary the most between populations, suggesting that sexual selection alone is not responsible for driving divergence in cuticular composition. We also examined differences in cuticular composition with adult age, revealing that the proportion of all but one of the 14 lipid classes we identified changes significantly with age in at least one population. Overall the pattern of variation with age is fairly consistent across populations, with the proportion of shorter-chain compounds increasing with age.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;âAlthough there are several well-established hypotheses for the origins of postmating isolation during allopatric divergence, there have been very few attempts to determine their relative importance in nature. We have developed an approach based on knowledge of the differing evolutionary histories of populations within species that allows systematic comparison of the predictions of these hypotheses. In previous work, we have applied this methodology to mating signal variation and premating reproductive isolation between populations of the meadow grasshopper \textit{Chorthippus parallelus}. Here we review the principles behind our approach and report a study measuring postmating isolation in the same set of populations. The populations have known and differing evolutionary histories and relationships resulting from the colonization of northern Europe following the last glaciation. We use a maximum-likelihood analysis to compare the observed pattern of postmating isolation with the predictions of the hypotheses that isolation primarily evolves either as a result of gradual accumulation of mutations in allopatry, or through processes associated with colonization, such as founder events. We also quantify the extent to which degree of postmating isolation can be predicted by genetic distance. Our results suggest that although there is only a weak correlation between genetic distance and postmating isolation, long periods of allopatry do lead to postmating isolation. In contrast to the pattern of premating isolation described in our previous study, colonization does not seem to be associated with increased postmating isolation.},

  Abstract                 = {To understand the process of speciation, we need to identify the evolutionary phenomena associated with divergence between populations of the same species. A powerful approach is to compare patterns of trait differences between populations differing in their evolutionary histories. A recent study of genetic divergence between populations of the meadow grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus, from different locations around Europe has allowed us to use this species to investigate which aspects of evolutionary history are associated with divergence in morphology and mating signals. During the last glaciation C. parallelus was confined to a number of refugia in southern Europe and has subsequently recolonized the northern part of the continent. This process of isolation followed by range expansion has created populations differing markedly in their evolutionary pasts--some have been isolated from one another for thousands of years, others have undergone repeated founder events, and others now live in sympatry with a closely related species. Using laboratory-reared grasshoppers from 12 different populations with a range of evolutionary histories, we quantify differences in morphology, chemical signals, and male calling-song. The observed pattern of divergence between these populations is then compared with the pattern predicted by hypotheses about what drives divergence. This comparison reveals that long periods in allopatry and processes associated with repeated founder events are both strongly associated with divergence.},

  Abstract                 = {There are many proposed routes for the origin of premating reproductive isolation, but few systematic studies aimed at testing their relative importance. Accumulated information about the biogeographical history of the European meadow grasshopper, Chorthippus parallelus, has allowed us to make a planned series of comparisons among populations aimed at distinguishing the contributions of some of these hypotheses. We have compared the effects on assortative mating of long-term isolation in glacial refugia, founder events during postglacial colonization, and sympatry with a closely related species. A likelihood-based analysis allowed us to separate effects of variation in male and female mating propensity among populations from variation in mate choice leading to assortative mating. All three effects contributed significantly to the overall variation in mating pattern in a set of 21 pairwise comparisons among seven populations. Male cuticular composition, but not other candidate signals, was significantly associated with the level of assortative mating. Of the hypotheses for the origin of reproductive isolation, only the predictions of the founder hypothesis explained a significant amount of the variation in assortative mating. This does not rule out the possiblity that there may be some other explanation. Having established the pattern of divergence, it is possible to generate hypotheses that explain our results at least as well as the founder hypothesis. However, because many such post hoc hypotheses are possible, they cannot be tested with this dataset. On this basis, our results favor the hypothesis that some aspect of the colonization process tends to accelerate divergence in mating signals leading to premating reproductive isolation. This could be accomplished through any one of several mechanisms. Colonization involves many bottlenecks as new populations are established at the edge of the range by long-distance migrants. Genetic effects may be important, but these bottlenecks may also alter the conditions under as suggested by Kaneshiro. At the same time, the colonizing populations may encounter novel environmental challenges. },

Here we show that in both the Felsenstein (1981) and Kirkpatrick (1982) models, a recombination suppressor is able to enhance the processes leading to speciation and increase its own frequency in the population.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>Conventional marker-based genotyping platforms are widely available, but not without their limitations. In this context, we developed Sequence-Based Genotyping (SBG), a technology for simultaneous marker discovery and co-dominant scoring, using next-generation sequencing. SBG offers users several advantages including a generic sample preparation method, a highly robust genome complexity reduction strategy to facilitate <italic>de novo</italic> marker discovery across entire genomes, and a uniform bioinformatics workflow strategy to achieve genotyping goals tailored to individual species, regardless of the availability of a reference sequence. The most distinguishing features of this technology are the ability to genotype any population structure, regardless whether parental data is included, and the ability to co-dominantly score SNP markers segregating in populations. To demonstrate the capabilities of SBG, we performed marker discovery and genotyping in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and lettuce, two plant species of diverse genetic complexity and backgrounds. Initially we obtained 1,409 SNPs for arabidopsis, and 5,583 SNPs for lettuce. Further filtering of the SNP dataset produced over 1,000 high quality SNP markers for each species. We obtained a genotyping rate of 201.2 genotypes/SNP and 58.3 genotypes/SNP for arabidopsis (nâ=â222 samples) and lettuce (nâ=â87 samples), respectively. Linkage mapping using these SNPs resulted in stable map configurations. We have therefore shown that the SBG approach presented provides users with the utmost flexibility in garnering high quality markers that can be directly used for genotyping and downstream applications. Until advances and costs will allow for routine whole-genome sequencing of populations, we expect that sequence-based genotyping technologies such as SBG will be essential for genotyping of model and non-model genomes alike.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {The study of speciation has become one of the most active areas of evolutionary biology, and substantial progress has been made in documenting and understanding phenomena ranging from sympatric speciation and reinforcement to the evolutionary genetics of postzygotic isolation. This progress has been driven largely by empirical results, and most useful theoretical work has concentrated on making sense of empirical patterns. Given the complexity of speciation, mathematical theory is subordinate to verbal theory and generalizations about data. Nevertheless, mathematical theory can provide a useful classification of verbal theories; can help determine the biological plausibility of verbal theories; can determine whether alternative mechanisms of speciation are consistent with empirical patterns; and can occasionally provide predictions that go beyond empirical generalizations. We discuss recent examples of progress in each of these areas.},

  Abstract                 = {Asymmetric postmating isolation, where reciprocal interspecific crosses produce different levels of fertilization success or hybrid sterility/inviability, is very common. Darwin emphasized its pervasiveness in plants, but it occurs in all taxa assayed. This asymmetry often results from DobzhanskyâMuller incompatibilities (DMIs) involving uniparentally inherited genetic factors (e.g., gametophyteâsporophyte interactions in plants or cytoplasmicânuclear interactions). Typically, unidirectional (U) DMIs act simultaneously with bidirectional (B) DMIs between autosomal loci that affect reciprocal crosses equally. We model both classes of two-locus DMIs to make quantitative and qualitative predictions concerning patterns of isolation asymmetry in parental species crosses and in the hybrid F1 generation. First, we find conditions that produce expected differences. Second, we present a stochastic analysis of DMI accumulation to predict probable levels of asymmetry as divergence time increases. We find that systematic interspecific differences in relative rates of evolution for autosomal vs. nonautosomal loci can lead to different expected F1 fitnesses from reciprocal crosses, but asymmetries are more simply explained by stochastic differences in the accumulation of U DMIs. The magnitude of asymmetry depends primarily on the cumulative effects of U vs. B DMIs (which depend on heterozygous effects of DMIs), the average number of DMIs required to produce complete reproductive isolation (more asymmetry occurs when fewer DMIs are required), and the shape of the function describing how fitness declines as DMIs accumulate. Comparing our predictions to data from diverse taxa indicates that unidirectional DMIs, specifically involving sex chromosomes, cytoplasmic elements, and maternal effects, are likely to play an important role in postmating isolation.},

  Abstract                 = {"HALDANE's rule" states that, if species hybrids of one sex only are inviable or sterile, the afflicted sex is much more likely to be heterogametic (XY) than homogametic (XX). We show that most or all of the phenomena associated with HALDANE's rule can be explained by the simple hypothesis that alleles decreasing hybrid fitness are partially recessive. Under this hypothesis, the XY sex suffers more than the XX because X-linked alleles causing postzygotic isolation tend to have greater cumulative effects when hemizygous than when heterozygous, even though the XX sex carries twice as many such alleles. The dominance hypothesis can also account for the "large X effect," the disproportionate effect of the X chromosome on hybrid inviability/sterility. In addition, the dominance theory is consistent with: the long temporal lag between the evolution of heterogametic and homogametic postzygotic isolation, the frequency of exceptions to HALDANE's rule, puzzling Drosophila experiments in which "unbalanced" hybrid females, who carry two X chromosomes from the same species, remain fertile whereas F1 hybrid males are sterile, and the absence of cases of HALDANE's rule for hybrid inviability in mammals. We discuss several novel predictions that could lead to rejection of the dominance theory.},

We discuss briefly the philosophy of Bayesian inference and then present several algorithms for ABC. We then apply these algorithms in a number of examples. For most of these examples, the posterior distributions are known, and so we can compare the estimated posteriors derived from ABC to the true posteriors and verify that the algorithms recover the true posteriors accurately. We also consider a popular simulation-based model of recognition memory (REM) for which the true posteriors are unknown. We conclude with a number of recommendations for applying ABC methods to solve real-world problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Populations of the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, are comprised of at least two reproductively isolated, sympatric populations. In this issue, White et al. (2010) use extensive sampling, high-density tiling microarrays, and an updated reference genome to clarify and expand our knowledge of genomic differentiation between these populations. It is now clear that DNA near the centromeres of all three chromosomes are in near-perfect disequilibrium with each other. This is in stark contrast to the remaining 97% of the assembled genome, where fixed differences between populations have not been found, and many polymorphisms are shared. This pattern, coupled with direct evidence of hybridization in nature, supports models of "mosaic" speciation, where ongoing hybridization homogenizes variation in most of the genome while loci under strong selection remain in disequilibrium with each other. However, unambiguously demonstrating that selection maintains the association of these pericentric "speciation islands" in the face of gene flow is difficult. Low recombination at all three loci complicates the issue, and increases the probability that selection unrelated to the speciation process alters patterns of variation in these loci. Here, we discuss these different scenarios in light of this new data. },

  Abstract                 = {The African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (A. gambiae), provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of reproductive isolation because it is divided into two sympatric, partially isolated subtaxa known as M form and S form. With the annotated genome of this species now available, high-throughput techniques can be applied to locate and characterize the genomic regions contributing to reproductive isolation. In order to quantify patterns of differentiation within A. gambiae, we hybridized population samples of genomic DNA from each form to Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. We found that three regions, together encompassing less than 2.8 Mb, are the only locations where the M and S forms are significantly differentiated. Two of these regions are adjacent to centromeres, on Chromosomes 2L and X, and contain 50 and 12 predicted genes, respectively. Sequenced loci in these regions contain fixed differences between forms and no shared polymorphisms, while no fixed differences were found at nearby control loci. The third region, on Chromosome 2R, contains only five predicted genes; fixed differences in this region were also verified by direct sequencing. These "speciation islands" remain differentiated despite considerable gene flow, and are therefore expected to contain the genes responsible for reproductive isolation. Much effort has recently been applied to locating the genes and genetic changes responsible for reproductive isolation between species. Though much can be inferred about speciation by studying taxa that have diverged for millions of years, studying differentiation between taxa that are in the early stages of isolation will lead to a clearer view of the number and size of regions involved in the genetics of speciation. Despite appreciable levels of gene flow between the M and S forms of A. gambiae, we were able to isolate three small regions of differentiation where genes responsible for ecological and behavioral isolation are likely to be located. We expect reproductive isolation to be due to changes at a small number of loci, as these regions together contain only 67 predicted genes. Concentrating future mapping experiments on these regions should reveal the genes responsible for reproductive isolation between forms.},

  Abstract                 = {The two North Atlantic eel species, the European and the American eel, represent an ideal system in which to study parallel selection patterns due to their sister species status and the presence of ongoing gene flow. A panel of 80 coding-gene SNPs previously analyzed in American eel was used to genotype European eel individuals (glass eels) from 8 sampling locations across the species distribution. We tested for single-generation signatures of spatially varying selection in European eel by searching for elevated genetic differentiation using FST-based outlier tests and by testing for significant associations between allele frequencies and environmental variables.We found signatures of possible selection at a total of 11 coding-gene SNPs. Candidate genes for local selection constituted mainly genes with a major role in metabolism as well as defense genes. Contrary to what has been found for American eel, only 2 SNPs in our study correlated with differences in temperature, which suggests that other explanatory variables may play a role. None of the genes found to be associated with explanatory variables in European eel showed any correlations with environmental factors in the previous study in American eel.The different signatures of selection between species could be due to distinct selective pressures associated with the much longer larval migration for European eel relative to American eel. The lack of parallel selection in North Atlantic eels could also be due to most phenotypic traits being polygenic, thus reducing the likelihood of selection acting on the same genes in both species.},

  Abstract                 = {Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a basic molecular biology technique with a multiplicity of uses, including deoxyribonucleic acid cloning and sequencing, functional analysis of genes, diagnosis of diseases, genotyping and discovery of genetic variants. Reliable primer design is crucial for successful PCR, and for over a decade, the open-source Primer3 software has been widely used for primer design, often in high-throughput genomics applications. It has also been incorporated into numerous publicly available software packages and web services. During this period, we have greatly expanded Primer3's functionality. In this article, we describe Primer3's current capabilities, emphasizing recent improvements. The most notable enhancements incorporate more accurate thermodynamic models in the primer design process, both to improve melting temperature prediction and to reduce the likelihood that primers will form hairpins or dimers. Additional enhancements include more precise control of primer placement-a change motivated partly by opportunities to use whole-genome sequences to improve primer specificity. We also added features to increase ease of use, including the ability to save and re-use parameter settings and the ability to require that individual primers not be used in more than one primer pair. We have made the core code more modular and provided cleaner programming interfaces to further ease integration with other software. These improvements position Primer3 for continued use with genome-scale data in the decade ahead.},

Dinucleotide microsatellites are not more frequent in C. biguttulus, but repeat arrays are 1.4 to 2 times longer than in other insect species. The average repeat number in C. biguttulus lies in the range of higher vertebrates. Natural populations are highly variable. At least 30 alleles per locus were found and the expected heterozygosity is above 0.95 at all three loci studied. In contrast, the observed heterozygosity is much lower (< or = 0.51), which could be caused by long null alleles.},

We partially cloned fru from a hemimetabolous insect for the first time and we compared fru among three closely related and acoustically communicating grasshopper species: Chorthippus biguttulus, C. brunneus, and C. mollis. The fru of grasshoppers is organized similarly to fru of holometabolous insects, with a BTB and Zn-finger domains separated by a nonconserved repetitive linker. As in Drosophila, several transcripts of fru are found in grasshoppers. We also present evidence for the coexistence of several copies of fru in the grasshopper genome. Within species these copies are almost identical and carry almost-fixed species-specific differences. This suggests that the paralogous copies of fru in grasshoppers do not evolve independently from each other.},

  Abstract                 = {Character displacement can reduce costly interspecific interactions between young species. We investigated the mechanisms behind divergence in three key traits-breeding habitat choice, timing of breeding, and plumage coloration-in Ficedula flycatchers. We found that male pied flycatchers became expelled from the preferred deciduous habitat into mixed forest as the superior competitor, collared flycatchers, increased in numbers. The peak in food abundance differs between habitats, and the spatial segregation was paralleled by an increased divergence in timing of breeding between the two species. Male pied flycatchers vary from brown to black with brown coloration being more frequent in sympatry with collared flycatchers, a pattern often proposed to result from selection against hybridization, that is, reinforcement. In contrast to this view, we show that brown male pied flycatchers more often hybridize than black males. Male pied flycatcher plumage coloration influenced the territory obtained in areas of co-occurrence with collared flycatchers, and brown male pied flycatchers experienced higher relative fitness than black males when faced with heterospecific competition. We suggest that allopatric divergence in resource defense ability causes a feedback loop at secondary contact where male pied flycatchers with the most divergent strategy compared to collared flycatchers are favored by selection.},

  Abstract                 = {Sexually selected traits display substantial genetic variance [1, 2], in conflict with the expectation that sexual selection will deplete it [3-5]. Condition dependence is thought to resolve this paradox [5-7], but experimental tests that relate the direction of sexual selection to the availability of genetic variance are lacking. Here, we show that condition-dependent expression is not sufficient to maintain genetic variance available to sexual selection in multiple male sexually selected traits. We employed an experimental design that simultaneously determined the quantitative genetic basis of nine male cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of Drosophila bunnanda, the extent of condition dependence of these traits, and the strength and direction of sexual selection acting upon them. The CHCs of D. bunnanda are condition dependent, with 18\% of the genetic variance in male body size explained by genetic variance in CHCs. Despite the presence of genetic variance in individual male traits, 98\% of the genetic variance in CHCs was found to be orientated more than 88 degrees away from the direction of sexual selection and therefore unavailable to selection. A lack of genetic variance in male traits in the direction of sexual selection may represent a general feature of sexually selected systems, even in the presence of condition-dependent trait expression.},

However, discovery of polymorphisms in low polymorphic species is still a challenging and costly endeavor, despite widespread availability of Sanger sequencing technology. We present CRoPS as a novel approach for polymorphism discovery by combining the power of reproducible genome complexity reduction of AFLP with Genome Sequencer (GS) 20/GS FLX next-generation sequencing technology. With CRoPS, hundreds-of-thousands of sequence reads derived from complexity-reduced genome sequences of two or more samples are processed and mined for SNPs using a fully-automated bioinformatics pipeline. We show that over 75\% of putative maize SNPs discovered using CRoPS are successfully converted to SNPWave assays, confirming them to be true SNPs derived from unique (single-copy) genome sequences. By using CRoPS, polymorphism discovery will become affordable in organisms with high levels of repetitive DNA in the genome and/or low levels of polymorphism in the (breeding) germplasm without the need for prior sequence information.},

These associations were compared with associations between larval habitat variables and the presence of mosquito larvae at a finer spatial scale. Collection data for the larvae of one Aedes species and three species-groups of Anopheles, all of which are involved in pathogen transmission, were used. A variety of northern Thai landscapes were included, such as upland villages, lowland villages and peri-urban areas. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations. Generally, land cover and landscape variables explained the presence of larvae as well as did larval habitat variables. Results were best for species/species-groups with specific habitat requirements. Land cover variables act as proxies for the types of habitat available and their attributes. Good knowledge of the habitat requirements of the immature stages of mosquitoes is necessary for interpreting the effects of land cover.},

  Abstract                 = {The prediction that selection affects the genome in a locus-specific way also affecting flanking neutral variation, known as genetic hitchhiking, enables the use of polymorphic markers in noncoding regions to detect the footprints of selection. However, as the strength of the selective footprint on a locus depends on the distance from the selected site and will decay with time due to recombination, the utilization of polymorphic markers closely linked to coding regions of the genome should increase the probability of detecting the footprints of selection as more gene-containing regions are covered. The occurrence of highly polymorphic microsatellites in the untranslated regions of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) is a potentially useful source of gene-associated polymorphisms which has thus far not been utilized for genome screens in natural populations. In this study, we searched for the genetic signatures of divergent selection by screening 95 genomic and EST-derived mini- and microsatellites in eight natural Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., populations from different spatial scales inhabiting contrasting natural environments (salt-, brackish, and freshwater habitat). Altogether, we identified nine EST-associated microsatellites, which exhibited highly significant deviations from the neutral expectations using different statistical methods at various spatial scales and showed similar trends in separate population samples from different environments (salt-, brackish, and freshwater habitats) and sea areas (Barents vs. White Sea). We consider these ESTs as the best candidate loci affected by divergent selection, and hence, they serve as promising genes associated with adaptive divergence in Atlantic salmon. Our results demonstrate that EST-linked microsatellite genome scans provide an efficient strategy for discovering functional polymorphisms, especially in nonmodel organisms.},

This paper aims to bring together and compare the relative strengths and limitations of various potentially useful research strategies for dissecting functionally important genetic variation in a wide range of organisms. We briefly explore the relative strengths and limitations of traditional and emerging approaches and evaluate their potential use in free-living populations. While it is likely that much of the progress in functional genetic analyses will rely on progress in traditional model species, it is clear that with prudent choices of methods and appropriate sampling designs, much headway can be also made in a diverse range of species. We suggest that combining research approaches targeting different functional and biological levels can potentially increase understanding the genetic basis of ecological and evolutionary processes both in model and non-model organisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Identifying genomic regions targeted by positive selection has been a long-standing interest of evolutionary biologists. This objective was difficult to achieve until the recent emergence of next-generation sequencing, which is fostering the development of large-scale catalogues of genetic variation for increasing number of species. Several statistical methods have been recently developed to analyse these rich data sets, but there is still a poor understanding of the conditions under which these methods produce reliable results. This study aims at filling this gap by assessing the performance of genome-scan methods that consider explicitly the physical linkage among SNPs surrounding a selected variant. Our study compares the performance of seven recent methods for the detection of selective sweeps (iHS, nSL, EHHST, xp-EHH, XP-EHHST, XPCLR and hapFLK). We use an individual-based simulation approach to investigate the power and accuracy of these methods under a wide range of population models under both hard and soft sweeps. Our results indicate that XPCLR and hapFLK perform best and can detect soft sweeps under simple population structure scenarios if migration rate is low. All methods perform poorly with moderate-to-high migration rates, or with weak selection and very poorly under a hierarchical population structure. Finally, no single method is able to detect both starting and nearly completed selective sweeps. However, combining several methods (XPCLR or hapFLK with iHS or nSL) can greatly increase the power to pinpoint the selected region.},

The cline for this marker was relatively narrow in two adjoining western central high cols (Peyrelue: 9.7 km and Portalet: 13.3 km) but was significantly wider in another central high col towards the east (Quillane: 42.3 km), indicating that a different combination of forces has been operating on this locus in different regions of the Pyrenees.},

In a belt about 200&nbsp;km wide, not only were one or the other pure species found, but also males with intermediate song characters. C. albomarginatus and C. oschei were hybridised in the laboratory, and F1 hybrid males as well as F2 hybrid males produced intermediate song patterns, quite similar to those recorded in the field. We defined a "hybrid song score" for intermediate songs. The score showed a bimodal distribution with most songs resembling one or other parental type, but with only a few intermediates. At several localities, where hybrids with songs similar to one of the parental species dominated, some individual males sang more similarly to the other species. In one locality, two hybrid populations only 3&nbsp;km apart had different parental types. Hybrid songs can contain novel elements, even more complex than the parental ones, which may offer a new starting point for sexual selection. We suggest that genetic introgression occurs between the two sibling species C. albomarginatus and C. oschei within a wide hybrid zone stretching over a distance of several hundred kilometres, but with a patchy spatial distribution.},

The role of sexual selection in the evolution of acoustic signals in bush crickets is much less important than in the evolution of other nonacoustic signals employed during direct contact. Acoustic signals of crickets (Grylloidea) are involved in both distant and short-range communication. Acoustic courtship signals, along with other courtship components, may offer the material for sexual selection, although, essentially, evolution of acoustic signals in crickets is determined by the acoustic surroundings. Acoustic communication in the grasshoppers of the subfamily Gomphocerinae is mainly a short-distance communication. Acoustic signals of Gomphocerinae are highly variable and elaborate in temporal parameters, and therefore can serve for evaluation of the mate "quality". Song evolution in this group is to a greater extent driven by sexual selection than by the acoustic surroundings and, therefore, could proceed faster than in other groups of Orthoptera and play a major role in speciation.},

Here, we present a genetic analysis of the courtship song differences between two closely related grasshopper species Ch. albomarginatus and Ch. oschei. Measurements of seven courtship song characters and one parameter of courtship visual display were compared among parentals, F(1) and F(2) hybrids, and backcrosses. Variation in one morphological character, the number of stridulatory pegs, was studied as well. The distributions of song phenotypes were more consistent with a type-III genetic architecture, which involves complementary or duplicate pairs of loci. We suggest that this type of architecture may provide the novel elements of the hybrid songs, even more complex than the parental ones, which may offer a new starting point for sexual selection. One parameter of the visual display appeared to be controlled by a single locus, but differences in other characters of visual display could be explained by a more complex inheritance pattern. Inheritance of the peg number differences was consistent with a simple polygenic additive model. Sex linkage and/or maternal effects were not detected for any trait. We found a disproportionate influence of the Ch. albomarginatus parent on most hybrid song characteristics and the visual display, and this may support a previously suggested idea that Ch. albomarginatus is an ancestral form and Ch. oschei is a derived species.},

On the basis of phylogenetic analyses of almost 300 DNA sequences of the mitochondrial control region of East African cichlids, we find that the Lake Victoria cichlid flock is derived from the geologically older Lake Kivu. We suggest that the two seeding lineages may have already been lake-adapted when they colonized Lake Victoria. A haplotype analysis further shows that the most recent desiccation of Lake Victoria did not lead to a complete extinction of its endemic cichlid fauna and that the major lineage diversification took place about 100,000 years ago.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimates of the fixation index, FST, have been used as measures of population differentiation for many decades. However, there have been persistent voices in the literature suggesting that these statistics do not measure true differentiation. In particular, the statistics Nei's GST and Wier and Cockerham's Œ∏ have been criticized for being ‚Äòconstrained‚Äô to not equal one in some situations that seem to represent maximal differentiation. Here, we address the issue of how to evaluate exactly how much information a particular statistic contains about the process of differentiation. This criterion can be used to counter most concerns about the performance of GST (and related statistics), while also being reconciled with the insights of those who have proposed alternative measures of differentiation. In particular, the likelihood-based framework that we put forward can justify the use of GST as an effective measure of differentiation, but also shows that in some situations GST is insufficient on its own and needs supplementing by another measure such as Jost's D or Hedrick's G‚Ä≤ST. This approach will become increasingly important in the future, as greater emphasis is placed on analysing large data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {The role of natural selection in speciation, first described by Darwin, has finally been widely accepted. Yet, the nature and time course of the genetic changes that result in speciation remain mysterious. To date, genetic analyses of speciation have focused almost exclusively on retrospective analyses of reproductive isolation between species or subspecies and on hybrid sterility or inviability rather than on ecologically based barriers to gene flow. However, if we are to fully understand the origin of species, we must analyze the process from additional vantage points. By studying the genetic causes of partial reproductive isolation between specialized ecological races, early barriers to gene flow can be identified before they become confounded with other species differences. This population-level approach can reveal patterns that become invisible over time, such as the mosaic nature of the genome early in speciation. Under divergent selection in sympatry, the genomes of incipient species become temporary genetic mosaics in which ecologically important genomic regions resist gene exchange, even as gene flow continues over most of the genome. Analysis of such mosaic genomes suggests that surprisingly large genomic regions around divergently selected quantitative trait loci can be protected from interrace recombination by "divergence hitchhiking.'' Here, I describe the formation of the genetic mosaic during early ecological speciation, consider the establishment, effects, and transitory nature of divergence hitchhiking around key ecologically important genes, and describe a 2-stage model for genetic divergence during ecological speciation with gene flow. },

A better understanding of these patterns should provide valuable information on the evolution of genes located on the X chromosome.

For such species, and specially for low-coverage data, it is necessary to obtain estimates of inbreeding coefficients (F) for each individual before calling genotypes. Here, we present two methods for estimating inbreeding coefficients from NGS data based on an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We assess the impact of taking inbreeding into account when calling genotypes or estimating the site frequency spectrum (SFS), and demonstrate a marked increase in accuracy on low-coverage highly inbred samples.

  Abstract                 = {Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized research in evolutionary biology, by increasing the sequencing speed and reducing the experimental costs. However, sequencing errors are higher than in traditional technologies and, furthermore, many studies rely on low-depth sequencing. Under these circumstances, the use of standard methods for inferring genotypes leads to biased estimates of nucleotide variation, which can bias all downstream analyses. Through simulations, we assessed the bias in estimating genetic distances under several different scenarios. The results indicate that naive methods for assigning individual genotypes greatly overestimate genetic distances. We propose a novel method to estimate genetic distances that is suitable for low-depth NGS data and takes genotype call statistical uncertainty into account. We applied this method to investigate the genetic structure of domesticated and wild strains of rice. We implemented this approach in an open-source software and discuss further directions of phylogenetic analyses within this novel probabilistic framework.¬†¬© 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, ‚óè‚óè, ‚óè‚óè‚Äì‚óè‚óè.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract. Mosaic hybrid zones arise when ecologically differentiated taxa hybridize across a network of habitat patches. Frequent interbreeding across a small-scale patchwork can erode species differences that might have been preserved in a clinal hybrid zone. In particular, the rapid breakdown of neutral divergence sets an upper limit to the time for which differences at marker loci can persist. We present here a case study of a mosaic hybrid zone between the fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata (Anura: Discoglossidae) near Apahida in Romania. In our 20 Ã 20 km study area, we detected no evidence of a clinal transition but found a strong association between aquatic habitat and mean allele frequencies at four molecular markers. In particular, pure populations of B. bombina in ponds appear to cause massive introgression into the surrounding B. variegata gene pool found in temporary aquatic sites. Nevertheless, the genetic structure of these hybrid populations was remarkably similar to those of a previously studied transect near Pescenica (Croatia), which had both clinal and mosaic features: estimates of heterozygote deficit and linkage disequilibrium in each country are similar. In Apahida, the observed strong linkage disequilibria should stem from an imperfect habitat preference that guides most (but not all) adults into the habitats to which they are adapted. In the absence of a clinal structure, the inferred migration rate between habitats implies that associations between selected loci and neutral markers should break down rapidly. Although plausible selection strengths can maintain differentiation at those loci adapting the toads to either permanent or temporary breeding sites, the divergence at neutral markers must be transient. The hybrid zone may be approaching a state in which the gene pools are homogenized at all but the selected loci, not dissimilar from an early stage of sympatric divergence.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic recombination and, in particular, genetic shuffling are at odds with sequence comparison by alignment, which assumes conservation of contiguity between homologous segments. A variety of theoretical foundations are being used to derive alignment-free methods that overcome this limitation. The formulation of alternative metrics for dissimilarity between sequences and their algorithmic implementations are reviewed.The overwhelming majority of work on alignment-free sequence has taken place in the past two decades, with most reports published in the past 5 years. Two main categories of methods have been proposed-methods based on word (oligomer) frequency, and methods that do not require resolving the sequence with fixed word length segments. The first category is based on the statistics of word frequency, on the distances defined in a Cartesian space defined by the frequency vectors, and on the information content of frequency distribution. The second category includes the use of Kolmogorov complexity and Chaos Theory. Despite their low visibility, alignment-free metrics are in fact already widely used as pre-selection filters for alignment-based querying of large applications. Recent work is furthering their usage as a scale-independent methodology that is capable of recognizing homology when loss of contiguity is beyond the possibility of alignment.Most of the alignment-free algorithms reviewed were implemented in MATLAB code and are available at http://bioinformatics.musc.edu/resources.html},

In teleost fishes, which occupy the lower part of genome size range, the negative relationship between both parameters was observed. Two positive linear relationships were found between mean genome size and GC-percent of the main vertebrate groups (one includes fishes, amphibians, and mammals, the other consists of reptiles and birds, which show the higher GC-percent for their genome sizes). Distribution of variance between taxonomic levels indicates that GC-percent is more evolutionarily conservative than genome size in anamniotes. Anuran amphibians show the greatest part of genome size variability at the lower taxonomic levels as compared to other vertebrates (with no additional variance already above the genus level). The data obtained with different methods are compared. It is shown that the proposed method can provide useful data for studies on genome evolution and biodiversity.},

  Abstract                 = {Flow cytometry with the AT-specific fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 (HO) and the GC-specific fluorochrome olivomycin (OM) was used for measurement of base pair specific DNA content in 20 species of vertebrates. The results were found to be in good correlation with the biochemical literature on base pair frequencies (r = 0.972, P < 1 x 10(-8)). This correlation allows one to determine the percent of GC/AT-pairs and genome size from flow cytometric data. The genome sizes obtained were compared with the literature data on flow cytometric genome size values determined with the use of propidium iodide (PI) that is usually believed to be non-base pair specific. The results were found to be in general agreement; however, the previously reported slight GC-preference of PI is confirmed. The optimal conditions for flow cytometry of AT/GC ratio and genome size with the use of OM and HO are discussed. The approach can be useful for research in ecology, fisheries science, species conservation, and other environmental studies as a tool for rapid survey of a vast array of specimens.

  Abstract                 = {Two subspecies of the grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus meet in the Pyrenees forming a hybrid zone several kilometers wide. Crosses between the two pure taxa result in sterile male offspring and normal females (i.e., Haldane's rule applies). However, no such dysfunction has been detected in hybrid males collected through the center of the hybrid zone. By assessing the level of dysfunction in the offspring of reciprocal crosses, it was possible to map clines for the genes responsible for dysfunction through the zone. This analysis shows that there is no abrupt transition between incompatible genomes in the field. Crosses were also made between females collected from a transect spanning the hybrid zone and pure males of both subspecies. This reveals noncoincident clines for dysfunction near the center of the hybrid zone such that the dysfunction expressed in the offspring of these crosses is less than expected from simple models. More complex models involving interaction among genes must be invoked. Also, the possibility exists that since the postglacial contact of these two grasshopper taxa, hybrid dysfunction has become ameliorated by the evolution of modifiers. This hybrid zone is thought to be a tension zone, maintained by a balance between selection against hybrid genotypes and dispersal into the zone center. The lessening of hybrid disadvantage over time through the breakdown of epistatic interactions by recombination or through modification could account for the general lack of dysfunction in field collected hybrids today.},

  Abstract                 = {Population structure and history have similar effects on the genetic diversity at all neutral loci. However, some marker loci may also have been strongly influenced by natural selection. Selection shapes genetic diversity in a locus-specific manner. If we could identify those loci that have responded to selection during the divergence of populations, then we may obtain better estimates of the parameters of population history by excluding these loci. Previous attempts were made to identify outlier loci from the distribution of sample statistics under neutral models of population structure and history. Unfortunately these methods depend on assumptions about population structure and history that usually cannot be verified. In this article, we define new population-specific parameters of population divergence and construct sample statistics that are estimators of these parameters. We then use the joint distribution of these estimators to identify outlier loci that may be subject to selection. We found that outlier loci are easier to recognize when this joint distribution is conditioned on the total number of allelic states represented in the pooled sample at each locus. This is so because the conditional distribution is less sensitive to the values of nuisance parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {The recent advent of high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technologies makes it possible to produce, easily and cost effectively, large amounts of detailed data on the genotype composition of populations. Detecting locus-specific effects may help identify those genes that have been, or are currently, targeted by natural selection. How best to identify these selected regions, loci, or single nucleotides remains a challenging issue. Here, we introduce a new model-based method, called SelEstim, to distinguish putative selected polymorphisms from the background of neutral (or nearly neutral) ones and to estimate the intensity of selection at the former. The underlying population genetic model is a diffusion approximation for the distribution of allele frequency in a population subdivided into a number of demes that exchange migrants. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling from the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters, in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We present evidence from stochastic simulations, which demonstrates the good power of SelEstim to identify loci targeted by selection and to estimate the strength of selection acting on these loci, within each deme. We also reanalyze a subset of SNP data from the Stanford HGDP-CEPH Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel to illustrate the performance of SelEstim on real data. In agreement with previous studies, our analyses point to a very strong signal of positive selection upstream of the LCT gene, which encodes for the enzyme lactase-phlorizin hydrolase and is associated with adult-type hypolactasia. The geographical distribution of the strength of positive selection across the Old World matches the interpolated map of lactase persistence phenotype frequencies, with the strongest selection coefficients in Europe and in the Indus Valley.},

  Abstract                 = {Many East African mountains are characterized by an exceptionally high biodiversity. Here we assess the hypothesis that climatic fluctuations during the Plio-Pleistocene led to ecological fragmentation with subsequent genetic isolation and speciation in forest habitats in East Africa. Hypotheses on speciation in savannah lineages are also investigated. To do this, mitochondrial DNA sequences from a group of bush crickets consisting of both forest and savannah inhabiting taxa were analysed in relation to Plio-Pleistocene range fragmentations indicated by palaeoclimatic studies. Coalescent modelling and mismatch distributions were used to distinguish between alternative biogeographical scenarios. The results indicate two radiations: the earliest one overlaps in time with the global spread of C4 grasslands and only grassland inhabiting lineages originated in this radiation. Climatically induced retraction of forest to higher altitudes about 0.8 million years ago, promoting vicariant speciation in species inhabiting the montane zone, can explain the second radiation. Although much of the biodiversity in East Africa is presently threatened by climate change, past climatic fluctuations appear to have contributed to the species richness observed in the East African hot spots. Perceiving forests as centres of speciation reinforces the importance of conserving the remaining forest patches in the region.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel DNA fingerprinting technique called AFLP is described. The AFLP technique is based on the selective PCR amplification of restriction fragments from a total digest of genomic DNA. The technique involves three steps: (i) restriction of the DNA and ligation of oligonucleotide adapters, (ii) selective amplification of sets of restriction fragments, and (iii) gel analysis of the amplified fragments. PCR amplification of restriction fragments is achieved by using the adapter and restriction site sequence as target sites for primer annealing. The selective amplification is achieved by the use of primers that extend into the restriction fragments, amplifying only those fragments in which the primer extensions match the nucleotides flanking the restriction sites. Using this method, sets of restriction fragments may be visualized by PCR without knowledge of nucleotide sequence. The method allows the specific co-amplification of high numbers of restriction fragments. The number of fragments that can be analyzed simultaneously, however, is dependent on the resolution of the detection system. Typically 50-100 restriction fragments are amplified and detected on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The AFLP technique provides a novel and very powerful DNA fingerprinting technique for DNAs of any origin or complexity.},

Transitions are favoured over transversions among spontaneous mutations, and the direction and strength of selection on proteins and RNA appears to depend on mutation type. As the complexity of the nucleotide-substitution process has become apparent, problems with classlcal methods of estimating transition bias have been recognized. These problems
arise because there is a fundamental difference between ratios of numbers of differences among sequences and ratios
of rates, and because classical methods are not easily generalized. Several new methods are now available.},

All three species were well differentiated from each other at the microsatellite loci. Given the almost complete absence of mtDNA differentiation between An. dirus A and D, this endorses the previous suggestion of mtDNA introgression between these species. The high degree of differentiation between the northern and southern population of An. dirus C (RST = 0.401), in agreement with mtDNA data, is suggestive of incipient species. The lack of genetic structure indicated by microsatellites in four populations of An. dirus A across northern Thailand also concurs with mtDNA data. However, in An. dirus D a limited but significant level of structure was detected by microsatellites over ~400 km in northern Thailand, whereas the mtDNA detected no population differentiation over a much larger area (>1200 km). There is prior evidence for population expansion in the mtDNA. If this is due to a selective sweep originating in An. dirus D, the microsatellite data may indicate greater barriers to gene flow within An. dirus D than in species A. Alternatively, there may have been historical introgression of mtDNA and subsequent demographic expansion which occurred first in An. dirus D so enabling it to accumulate some population differentiation. In the latter case the lack of migration-drift equilibrium precludes the inference of absolute or relative values of gene flow in An. dirus A and D.},

To distinguish five species of the complex that occur in Thailand, a method using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed. The method utilizes allele-specific amplification to detect fixed differences between the species in the DNA sequence of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 2. Primers were designed to amplify fragments of diagnostic length from the DNA of the different species. The method was tested on 179 mosquitoes of the An. dirus complex from many parts of Thailand and shown to be effective. Every specimen was unambiguously identified as species A, B, C, D or F (i.e. An. dirus s.s. species B, C, D or An. nemophilous, respectively) by the PCR method, with confirmation of 58/61 identifications from polytene chromosome characteristics. For the other three specimens (3/44 from Kanchanaburi 5 locality), there was disagreement between the PCR and chromosomal methods of species identification (probably due to errors in the chromosomal identifications). Primers can be combined in a single PCR reaction providing a rapid, sensitive and straightforward method of species identification. Only small quantities of DNA are required, leaving most of the mosquito to be used for other analyses.},

  Abstract                 = {Separating the confounding effects of long-term population history from gene flow can be difficult. Here, we address the question of what inferences about gene flow can be made from mitochondrial sequence data in three closely related species of mosquitoes, Anopheles dirus species A, C, and D, from southeast Asia. A total of 84 sequences of 923 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene were obtained from 14 populations in Thailand, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. The genealogy of sequences obtained from two populations of AN: dirus C indicates no contemporary gene flow between them. The F(ST) value of 0.421 therefore probably represents a recent common history, perhaps involving colonization events. Anopheles dirus A and D are parapatric, yet no differentiation was seen either within or between species. The starlike genealogy of their haplotypes, smooth unimodal mismatch distributions, and excess of low frequency mutations indicate population expansion in An. dirus A and D. This, rather than widespread gene flow, explains their low within-species F(ST) values (0.018 and 0.022). The greater genetic diversity of An. dirus D suggests that expansion occurred first in species D and subsequently in species A. The current geographical separation and low hybrid fitness of these species also argue against ongoing interspecific gene flow. They suggest instead either historical introgression of mtDNA from An. dirus D into species A followed by independent range expansions, or a selective sweep of mtDNA that originated in An. dirus D. While not excluding contemporary gene flow, historical population processes are sufficient to explain the data in An. dirus A and D. The genealogical relationships between haplotypes could not be used to make inferences of gene flow because of extensive homoplasy due to hypervariable sites and possibly also recombination. However, it is concluded that this approach, rather than the use of fixation indices, is required in the future to understand contemporary gene flow in these mosquitoes. The implications of these results for understanding gene flow in another important and comparable group of malaria vector mosquitoes in Africa, the An. gambiae complex, are also discussed.},

Identification of the four mainland species based on morphology is problematic.

A molecular phylogeny indicates the presence of at least one hitherto unrecognised species. Mosquitoes of chromosomal form K from eastern Thailand have a unique ITS2 sequence that is 3.7\% divergent from the next most closely related taxon (An. sawadwongporni) in the group. In the context of negligible intraspecific variation at ITS2, this suggests that chromosomal form K is most probably a distinct species. Although An. maculatus sensu stricto from northern Thailand and southern Thailand/peninsular Malaysia differ from each other in chromosomal banding pattern and vectorial capacity, no intraspecific variation was observed in the ITS2 sequences of this species over this entire geographic area despite an extensive survey. A PCR-based identification method was developed to distinguish five species of the group (An. maculatus, An. dravidicus, An. pseudowillmori, An. sawadwongporni and chromosomal form K) to assist field-based studies in northwestern Thailand. Sequences from 187 mosquitoes (mostly An. maculatus and An. sawadwongporni) revealed no intraspecific variation in specimens from Thailand, Cambodia, mainland China, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, suggesting that this identification method will be widely applicable in Southeast Asia. The lack of detectable genetic structure also suggests that populations of these species are either connected by gene flow and/or share a recent common history.},

Despite the use of semiautomated fluorescent technology that enabled fragment sizes to be determined precisely, some difficulty was encountered in allele classification.

We also present 100 bp PstI RAD markers for B. nana and closely related Betula tree species. Assembly of RAD markers in 15 individuals by alignment to the reference B. nana genome yielded 44-86k RAD loci per individual, whereas de novo RAD assembly yielded 64-121k loci per individual. Of the loci assembled by the de novo method, 3k homologous loci were found in all 15 individuals studied, and 35k in 10 or more individuals. Matching of RAD loci to RAD locus catalogues from the B. nana individual used for the reference genome showed similar numbers of matches from both methods of RAD locus assembly but indicated that the de novo RAD assembly method may overassemble some paralogous loci. In 12 individuals hetero-specific to B. nana 37-47k RAD loci matched a catalogue of RAD loci from the B. nana individual used for the reference genome, whereas 44-60k RAD loci aligned to the B. nana reference genome itself.

Here we present a draft 6.5âGb genome sequence of Locusta migratoria, which is the largest animal genome sequenced so far. Our findings indicate that the large genome size of L. migratoria is likely to be because of transposable element proliferation combined with slow rates of loss for these elements. Methylome and transcriptome analyses reveal complex regulatory mechanisms involved in microtubule dynamic-mediated synapse plasticity during phase change. We find significant expansion of gene families associated with energy consumption and detoxification, consistent with long-distance flight capacity and phytophagy. We report hundreds of potential insecticide target genes, including cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors and lethal genes. The L. migratoria genome sequence offers new insights into the biology and sustainable management of this pest species, and will promote its wide use as a model system.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing is a powerful approach for discovering genetic variation. Sensitive variant calling and haplotype inference from population sequencing data remain challenging. We describe methods for high-quality discovery, genotyping, and phasing of SNPs for low-coverage (approximately 5×) sequencing of populations, implemented in a pipeline called SNPTools. Our pipeline contains several innovations that specifically address challenges caused by low-coverage population sequencing: (1) effective base depth (EBD), a nonparametric statistic that enables more accurate statistical modeling of sequencing data; (2) variance ratio scoring, a variance-based statistic that discovers polymorphic loci with high sensitivity and specificity; and (3) BAM-specific binomial mixture modeling (BBMM), a clustering algorithm that generates robust genotype likelihoods from heterogeneous sequencing data. Last, we develop an imputation engine that refines raw genotype likelihoods to produce high-quality phased genotypes/haplotypes. Designed for large population studies, SNPTools' input/output (I/O) and storage aware design leads to improved computing performance on large sequencing data sets. We apply SNPTools to the International 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) Phase 1 low-coverage data set and obtain genotyping accuracy comparable to that of SNP microarray.},

  Abstract                 = {In many marine species, high levels of gene flow ensure that the genetic signal from population differentiation is weak. As a consequence, various errors associated with estimating population genetic parameters that might normally be safely ignored assume a relatively greater importance. This fact has important implications for the use of genetic data to address two common questions in fishery conservation and management: (1) How many stocks of a given species are there? and (2) How much gene flow occurs among stocks? This article discusses strategies to maximize the signal:noise ratio in genetic studies of marine species and suggests a quantitative method to correct for bias due to a common sampling problem. For many marine species, however, genetic methods alone cannot fully resolve these key management questions because the amount of migration necessary to eliminate most genetic evidence of stock structure (only a handful of individuals per generation) will generally be inconsequential as a force for rebuilding depleted populations on a time scale of interest to humans. These limitations emphasize the importance of understanding the biology and life history of the target species-first, to guide design of the sampling program, and second, so that additional information can be used to supplement indirect estimates of migration rates based on genetic data.},

To address this question, we integrate human variation information from the 1000 Genomes Project and activity data from the ENCODE Project. A broad range of transcribed and regulatory nonconserved elements show decreased human diversity, suggesting lineage-specific purifying selection. Conversely, conserved elements lacking activity show increased human diversity, suggesting that some recently became nonfunctional. Regulatory elements under human constraint in nonconserved regions were found near color vision and nerve-growth genes, consistent with purifying selection for recently evolved functions. Our results suggest continued turnover in regulatory regions, with at least an additional 4\% of the human genome subject to lineage-specific constraint.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary: Novel DNA sequencing technologies with the potential for up to three orders magnitude more sequence throughput than conventional Sanger sequencing are emerging. The instrument now available from Solexa Ltd, produces millions of short DNA sequences of 25 nt each. Due to ubiquitous repeats in large genomes and the inability of short sequences to uniquely and unambiguously characterize them, the short read length limits applicability for de novo sequencing. However, given the sequencing depth and the throughput of this instrument, stringent assembly of highly identical sequences can be achieved. We describe SSAKE, a tool for aggressively assembling millions of short nucleotide sequences by progressively searching through a prefix tree for the longest possible overlap between any two sequences. SSAKE is designed to help leverage the information from short sequence reads by stringently assembling them into contiguous sequences that can be used to characterize novel sequencing targets.Availability:http://www.bcgsc.ca/bioinfo/software/ssakeContact:rwarren@bcgsc.ca},

  Abstract                 = {There is a large variation in divergence times across genomic regions between human and chimpanzee. It has been suggested that this could partly result from selection against ancestral gene flow between incipient species in regions of the genome containing genetic incompatibilities. It is possible that such barriers to gene flow could arise in specific genes or in chromosomal inversions. I analysed patterns of lineage sorting that occur between human, chimpanzee and gorilla genomic sequences by examining divergent site patterns in >18 Mb genomic alignments. I develop a method to normalise site patterns by the mutational spectrum to minimise errors caused by misinference caused by recurrent mutation. Here I show that divergence times appear to be uniform between coding and noncoding sequences and between inverted and non-rearranged portions of chromosomes. I therefore find no evidence to support the large-scale accumulation of genetic incompatibilities at speciation genes or chromosomal inversions in the ancestral population of humans and chimpanzees. In addition, site patterns that are discordant with the species tree occur more frequently in regions with high human recombination rates. This could indicate the action of selective sweeps in the ancestral population, but could also be indicative of increased rates of homoplasy in these regions. I argue that these observations are compatible with a neutral allopatric model of speciation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. },

  Abstract                 = {Interspersed repeats have emerged as a valuable tool for studying neutral patterns of molecular evolution. Here we analyze variation in the rate and pattern of nucleotide substitution across all autosomes in the chicken genome by comparing the present-day CR1 repeat sequences with their ancestral copies and reconstructing nucleotide substitutions with a maximum likelihood model. The results shed light on the origin and evolution of large-scale heterogeneity in GC content found in the genomes of birds and mammals--the isochore structure. In contrast to mammals, where GC content is becoming homogenized, heterogeneity in GC content is being reinforced in the chicken genome. This is also supported by patterns of substitution inferred from alignments of introns in chicken, turkey, and quail. Analysis of individual substitution frequencies is consistent with the biased gene conversion (BGC) model of isochore evolution, and it is likely that patterns of evolution in the chicken genome closely resemble those in the ancestral amniote genome, when it is inferred that isochores originated. Microchromosomes and distal regions of macrochromosomes are found to have elevated substitution rates and a more GC-biased pattern of nucleotide substitution. This can largely be accounted for by a strong correlation between GC content and the rate and pattern of substitution. The results suggest that an interaction between increased mutability at CpG motifs and fixation biases due to BGC could explain increased levels of divergence in GC-rich regions.},

  Abstract                 = {Regional biases in substitution pattern are likely to be responsible for the large-scale variation in base composition observed in vertebrate genomes. However, the evolutionary forces responsible for these biases are still not clearly defined. In order to study the processes of mutation and fixation across the entire human genome, we analyzed patterns of substitution in Alu repeats since their insertion. We also studied patterns of human polymorphism within the repeats. There is a highly significant effect of recombination rate on the pattern of substitution, whereas no such effect is seen on the pattern of polymorphism. These results suggest that regional biases in substitution are caused by biased gene conversion, a process that increases the probability of fixation of mutations that increase GC content. Furthermore, the strongest correlate of substitution patterns is found to be male recombination rates rather than female or sex-averaged recombination rates. This indicates that in addition to sexual dimorphism in recombination rates, the sexes also differ in the relative rates of crossover and gene conversion.},

  Abstract                 = {During the past years, next-generation sequencing has become a key technology for many applications in the biomedical sciences. Throughput continues to increase and new protocols provide longer reads than currently available. In almost all applications, read mapping is a first step. Hence, it is crucial to have algorithms and implementations that perform fast, with high sensitivity, and are able to deal with long reads and a large absolute number of insertions and deletions.RazerS is a read mapping program with adjustable sensitivity based on counting q-grams. In this work, we propose the successor RazerS 3, which now supports shared-memory parallelism, an additional seed-based filter with adjustable sensitivity, a much faster, banded version of the Myers' bit-vector algorithm for verification, memory-saving measures and support for the SAM output format. This leads to a much improved performance for mapping reads, in particular, long reads with many errors. We extensively compare RazerS 3 with other popular read mappers and show that its results are often superior to them in terms of sensitivity while exhibiting practical and often competitive run times. In addition, RazerS 3 works without a pre-computed index.Source code and binaries are freely available for download at http://www.seqan.de/projects/razers. RazerS 3 is implemented in C++ and OpenMP under a GPL license using the SeqAn library and supports Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.},

  Abstract                 = {Existing theory for inferences about linkage disequilibrium is restricted to a measure defined on gametic frequencies. Unless gametic frequencies are directly observable, they are inferred from genotypic frequencies under the assumption of random union of gametes. Primary emphasis in this paper is given to genotypic data, and disequilibrium coefficients are defined for all subsets of two or more of the four genes, two at each of two loci, carried by an individual. Linkage disequilibrium coefficients are defined for genes within and between gametes, and methods of estimating and testing these coefficients are given for gametic data. For genotypic data, when coupling and repulsion double heterozygotes cannot be distinguished. Burrows' composite measure of linkage disequilibrium is discussed. In particular, the estimate for this measure and hypothesis tests based on it are compared to the usual maximum likelihood estimate of gametic linkage disequilibrium, and corresponding likelihood ratio or contingency chi-square tests. General use of the composite measure, whether or not random union of gametes is an appropriate assumption, is recommended. Attention is given to small samples, where the non-normality of gene frequencies will have greatest effect on methods of inference based on normal theory. Even tools such as Fisher's z-transformation for the correlation of gene frequencies are found to perform quite satisfactorily.},

  Abstract                 = {Sexual selection against immigrants is a mechanism that can regulate premating isolation between populations but, so far, few field studies have examined whether males can discriminate between immigrant and resident females. Males of the damselfly Calopteryx splendens show mate preferences and are able to force pre-copulatory tandems. We related male mate responses to the ecological characteristics of female origin, geographic distances between populations, and morphological traits of females to identify factors influencing male mate discrimination. Significant heterogeneity between populations in male mate responses towards females was found. In some populations, males discriminated strongly against immigrant females, whereas the pattern was reversed or nonsignificant in other populations. Immigrant females were particularly attractive to males when they came from populations with similar predation pressures and densities of conspecifics. By contrast, immigrant females from populations with strongly dissimilar predation pressures and conspecific densities were not attractive to males. Differences in the abiotic environment appeared to affect mating success to a lesser degree. This suggests that male mate discrimination is context-dependent and influenced by ecological differences between populations, a key prediction of ecological speciation theory. The results obtained in the present study suggest that gene-flow is facilitated between ecologically similar populations.¬†¬© 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 100, 506‚Äì518.},

  Abstract                 = {The role of hybridization and subsequent introgression has been demonstrated in an increasing number of species. Recently, Fontaine et¬†al. (Science, 347, 2015, 1258524) conducted a phylogenomic analysis of six members of the Anopheles gambiae species complex. Their analysis revealed a reticulate evolutionary history and pointed to extensive introgression on all four autosomal arms. The study further highlighted the complex evolutionary signals that the co-occurrence of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and introgression can give rise to in phylogenomic analyses. While tree-based methodologies were used in the study, phylogenetic networks provide a more natural model to capture reticulate evolutionary histories. In this work, we reanalyse the Anopheles data using a recently devised framework that combines the multispecies coalescent with phylogenetic networks. This framework allows us to capture ILS and introgression simultaneously, and forms the basis for statistical methods for inferring reticulate evolutionary histories. The new analysis reveals a phylogenetic network with multiple hybridization events, some of which differ from those reported in the original study. To elucidate the extent and patterns of introgression across the genome, we devise a new method that quantifies the use of reticulation branches in the phylogenetic network by each genomic region. Applying the method to the mosquito data set reveals the evolutionary history of all the chromosomes. This study highlights the utility of ‚Äònetwork thinking‚Äô and the new insights it can uncover, in particular in phylogenomic analyses of large data sets with extensive gene tree incongruence.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently-developed genotype imputation methods are a powerful tool for detecting untyped genetic variants that affect disease susceptibility in genetic association studies. However, existing imputation methods require individual-level genotype data, whereas in practice it is often the case that only summary data are available. For example this may occur because, for reasons of privacy or politics, only summary data are made available to the research community at large; or because only summary data are collected, as in DNA pooling experiments. In this article, we introduce a new statistical method that can accurately infer the frequencies of untyped genetic variants in these settings, and indeed substantially improve frequency estimates at typed variants in pooling experiments where observations are noisy. Our approach, which predicts each allele frequency using a linear combination of observed frequencies, is statistically straight-forward, and related to a long history of the use of linear methods for estimating missing values (e.g. Kriging). The main statistical novelty is our approach to regularizing the covariance matrix estimates, and the resulting linear predictors, which is based on methods from population genetics. We find that, besides being both fast and flexible - allowing new problems to be tackled that cannot be handled by existing imputation approaches purpose-built for the genetic context - these linear methods are also very accurate. Indeed, imputation accuracy using this approach is similar to that obtained by state-of-the art imputation methods that use individual-level data, but at a fraction of the computational cost.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuroactive substances were administered into the frontal protocerebrum of tethered male Gryllus bimaculatus by pressure injections from microcapillaries. All three types of species-specific song pattern (calling song, rivalry song and courtship song) could be elicited by injection of acetylcholine and cholinergic agonists. Injection of nicotine led to short bouts of calling song that occurred after a short latency. In contrast, muscarine elicited long-lasting stridulation that took longer to develop. The pharmacologically induced song patterns showed transitions from rivalry song to calling song and from calling song to courtship song, which also occur during natural behaviour. Stridulation induced by a cholinergic agonist could be immediately blocked by microinjection of (&ggr;)-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into the same neuropile sites. Administration of picrotoxin in resting crickets led to enhanced motor activity that incorporated the three different song patterns. We propose that, in the brain of the cricket, acetylcholine and GABA are putative transmitters involved in the control of stridulation. Histological analysis located the stimulation sites to an area between the pedunculus and the (&agr;)-lobe of the mushroom body in which the command neurons for calling song have dendritic arborizations.},

Neurophysiol. 87: 876-888, 2002. The species-specific sound production of acoustically communicating grasshoppers can be stimulated by pressure injection of both nicotinic and muscarinic agonists into the central body complex and a small neuropil situated posterior and dorsal to it. To determine the role of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the control of acoustic communication behavior and to identify the second-messenger pathways affected by mAChR-activation, muscarinic agonists and membrane-permeable drugs known to interfere with specific mechanisms of intracellular signaling pathways were pressure injected to identical sites in male grasshopper brains. Repeated injections of small volumes of muscarine elicited stridulation of increasing duration associated with decreased latencies. This suggested an accumulation of excitation over time that is consistent with the suggested role of mAChRs in controling courtship behavior: to provide increasing arousal leading to higher intensity of stridulation and finally initiating a mating attempt. At sites in the brain where muscarine stimulation was effective, stridulation could be evoked by forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase (AC); 8-Br-cAMP-activating protein kinase A (PKA); and 3-isobuty-1-methylxanthine, leading to the accumulation of endogenously generated cAMP through inhibition of phosphodiesterases. This suggested that mAChRs mediate excitation by stimulating the AC/cAMP/PKA pathway. In addition, muscarine-stimulated stridulation was inhibited by 2'-5'-dideoxyadenonsine and SQ 22536, two inhibitors of AC; H-89 and Rp-cAMPS, two inhibitors of PKA; and by U-73122 and neomycin, two agents that inhibit phospholipase C (PLC) by independent mechanisms. Because the inhibition of AC, PKA, or PLC by various individually applied substances entirely suppressed muscarine-evoked stridulation in a number of experiments, activation of both pathways, AC/cAMP/PKA and PLC/IP3/diacylglycerine, appeared to be necessary to mediate the excitatory effects of mAChRs. With these studies on an intact "behaving" grasshopper preparation, we present physiological relevance for mAChR-evoked excitation mediated by sequential activation of the AC- and PLC-initiated signaling pathways that has been reported in earlier in vitro studies.},

Under the assumption of considerable ongoing gene flow between M and S, these persistently divergent genomic islands were widely considered to be 'speciation islands'. In the course of microarray-based divergence mapping, we discovered a third centromere-associated island of divergence on chromosome 3, which was validated by targeted re-sequencing. To test for genetic association between the divergence islands on all three chromosomes, SNP-based assays were applied in four natural populations of M and S spanning West, Central and East Africa. Genotyping of 517 female M and S mosquitoes revealed nearly complete linkage disequilibrium between the centromeres of the three independently assorting chromosomes. These results suggest that despite the potential for inter-form gene flow through hybridization, actual (realized) gene flow between M and S may be substantially less than commonly assumed and may not explain most shared variation. Moreover, the possibility of very low gene flow calls into question whether diverged pericentromeric regions-characterized by reduced levels of variation and recombination-are in fact instrumental rather than merely incidental to the speciation process.},

However, the economic performance of fisheries depends on economic profit, not fish yield. The predictions of higher yields with reserves rely on intensive fishing pressures between reserves; the exorbitant costs of harvesting low-density populations erode profits. We incorporated this effect into a bioeconomic model to evaluate the economic performance of reserve-based management. Our results indicate that reserves can still benefit fisheries, even those targeting species that are expensive to harvest. However, in contrast to studies focused on yield, only a moderate proportion of the coast in reserves (with moderate harvest pressures outside reserves) is required to maximize profit. Furthermore, reserve area and harvest intensity can be traded off with little impact on profits, allowing for management flexibility while still providing higher profit than attainable under conventional management.},

  Abstract                 = {Range expansions are extremely common, but have only recently begun to attract attention in terms of their genetic consequences. As populations expand, demes at the wave front experience strong genetic drift, which is expected to reduce genetic diversity and potentially cause 'allele surfing', where alleles may become fixed over a wide geographical area even if their effects are deleterious. Previous simulation models show that range expansions can generate very strong selective gradients on dispersal, reproduction, competition and immunity. To investigate the effects of range expansion on genetic diversity and adaptation, we studied the population genomics of the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) in Ireland. The bank vole was likely introduced in the late 1920s and is expanding its range at a rate of ~2.5 km/year. Using genotyping-by-sequencing, we genotyped 281 bank voles at 5979 SNP loci. Fourteen sample sites were arranged in three transects running from the introduction site to the wave front of the expansion. We found significant declines in genetic diversity along all three transects. However, there was no evidence that sites at the wave front had accumulated more deleterious mutations. We looked for outlier loci with strong correlations between allele frequency and distance from the introduction site, where the direction of correlation was the same in all three transects. Amongst these outliers, we found significant enrichment for genic SNPs, suggesting the action of selection. Candidates for selection included several genes with immunological functions and several genes that could influence behaviour.},

In addition, journals should consider requiring that all data for published papers be archived, just as DNA sequences must be deposited in GenBank.

However, neutral loci can vary widely in their amount of genetic differentiation, even over the same geographic range. Unfortunately, the distribution of differentiation--as measured by an index such as F(ST)--depends on the details of the demographic history of the populations in question, even without spatially heterogeneous selection. Many methods designed to detect F(ST) outliers assume a specific model of demographic history, which can result in extremely high false positive rates for detecting loci under selection. We develop a new method that infers the distribution of F(ST) for loci unlikely to be strongly affected by spatially diversifying selection, using data on a large set of loci with unknown selective properties. Compared to previous methods, this approach, called OutFLANK, has much lower false positive rates and comparable power, as shown by simulation.},

data ? a time-consuming, error-prone and subjective process. We present a semi-automated
method of genotyping sequencer-collected AFLPs at predefined fragment locations (loci)
within the fingerprint. Our method uses thresholds of AFLP-polymerase chain reactionproduct
fluorescence intensity (peak height) in order to: (i) exclude AFLP loci that are likely
to contribute high rates of error to data sets, and (ii) determine the AFLP phenotype (fragment
presence or absence) at the retained loci. Error rate analysis is an integral part of this process
and is used to determine optimal thresholds that minimize genotyping error, while maximizing
the numbers of retained loci. We show that application of this method to a large AFLP data
set allows genotype calls that are rapid, objective and repeatable, facilitating the extraction
of reliable genotype data for molecular ecological studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are valuable genetic markers of human disease. They also comprise the highest potential density marker set available for mapping experimentally derived mutations in model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans. To facilitate the positional cloning of mutations we have identified polymorphisms in CB4856, an isolate from a Hawaiian island that shows a uniformly high density of polymorphisms compared with the reference Bristol N2 strain. Based on 5.4 Mbp of aligned sequences, we predicted 6,222 polymorphisms. Furthermore, 3,457 of these markers modify restriction enzyme recognition sites ('snip-SNPs') and are therefore easily detected as RFLPs. Of these, 493 were experimentally confirmed by restriction digest to produce a snip-SNP map of the worm genome. A mapping strategy using snip-SNPs and bulked segregant analysis (BSA) is outlined. CB4856 is crossed into a mutant strain, and exclusion of CB4856 alleles of a subset of snip-SNPs in mutant progeny is assessed with BSA. The proximity of a linked marker to the mutation is estimated by the relative proportion of each form of the biallelic marker in populations of wildtype and mutant genomes. The usefulness of this approach is illustrated by the rapid mapping of the dyf-5 gene.},

  Abstract                 = {Reproductive isolation is essential for the process of speciation and much has been learned in recent years about the ecology and underlying genetics of reproductive barriers. But plant species are typically isolated not by a single factor, but by a large number of different pre- and postzygotic barriers, and their potentially complex interactions. This phenomenon has often been ignored to date. Recent studies of the relative importance of different isolating barriers between plant species pairs concluded that prezygotic isolation is much stronger than postzygotic isolation. But studies of the patterns of reproductive isolation in plants did not find that prezygotic isolation evolves faster than postzygotic isolation, in contrast to most animals. This may be due to the multiple premating barriers that isolate most species pairs, some of which may be controlled by few genes of major effect and evolve rapidly, whereas others have a complex genetic architecture and evolve more slowly. Intrinsic postzygotic isolation in plants is correlated with genetic divergence, but some instrinsic postzygotic barriers evolve rapidly and are polymorphic within species. Extrinsic postzygotic barriers are rarely included in estimates of different components of reproductive isolation. Much remains to be learned about ecological and molecular interactions among isolating barriers. The role of reinforcement and reproductive character displacement in the evolution of premating barriers is an open topic that deserves further study. At the molecular level, chromosomal and genic isolation factors may be associated and act in concert to mediate reproductive isolation, but their interactions are only starting to be explored.},

  Abstract                 = {Genomic imprinting allows maternally and paternally derived alleles to have different patterns of expression (one allele is often silent). Kin selection provides an explanation of genomic imprinting because conflicts of interest can arise between paternally and maternally inherited alleles when they have different probabilities of being present in other individuals. Our aim here is to examine the extent to which conflicts between paternally and maternally inherited alleles could arise over the allocation of resources to male and female reproduction (sex allocation), for example, conflict over the offspring sex ratio. We examine the situations in which sex allocation is influenced by competitive or cooperative interactions between relatives: local resource competition, local mate competition, and local resource enhancement. We determine solutions for diploids and haplodiploids when either the mother or the offspring controls sex allocation. Our results suggest that the greatest conflict between paternally and maternally inherited alleles and therefore the strongest selection for genomic imprinting will occur in haplodiploid species where the offspring can control sex allocation, such as the social hymenoptera and the polyembryonic parasitoid wasps. Within the social hymenoptera, we expect especially strong selection for genomic imprinting in species subject to local resource competition, such as honeybees and army ants.},

  Abstract                 = {Association mapping approaches are dependent upon discovery and validation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To further association studies in Anopheles gambiae we conducted a major resequencing programme, primarily targeting regions within or close to candidate genes for insecticide resistance.Using two pools of mosquito template DNA we sequenced over 300 kbp across 660 distinct amplicons of the An. gambiae genome. Comparison of SNPs identified from pooled templates with those from individual sequences revealed a very low false positive rate. False negative rates were much higher and mostly resulted from SNPs with a low minor allele frequency. Pooled-template sequencing also provided good estimates of SNP allele frequencies. Allele frequency estimation success, along with false positive and negative call rates, improved significantly when using a qualitative measure of SNP call quality. We identified a total of 7062 polymorphic features comprising 6995 SNPs and 67 indels, with, on average, a SNP every 34 bp; a high rate of polymorphism that is comparable to other studies of mosquitoes. SNPs were significantly more frequent in members of the cytochrome p450 mono-oxygenases and carboxy/cholinesterase gene-families than in glutathione-S-transferases, other detoxification genes, and control genomic regions. Polymorphic sites showed a significantly clustered distribution, but the degree of SNP clustering (independent of SNP frequency) did not vary among gene families, suggesting that clustering of polymorphisms is a general property of the An. gambiae genome.The high frequency and clustering of SNPs has important ramifications for the design of high-throughput genotyping assays based on allele specific primer extension or probe hybridisation. We illustrate these issues in the context of the design of Illumina GoldenGate assays.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of novel sexual communication systems is integral to the process of speciation, as it discourages gene flow between incipient species. Physical linkage between genes underlying male-female communication (i.e. sexual signals and preferences for them) facilitates both rapid and coordinated divergence of sexual communication systems between populations and reduces recombination in the face of occasional hybridization between diverging populations. Despite these ramifications of the genetic architecture of sexual communication for sexual selection and speciation, few studies have examined this relationship empirically. Previous studies of the closely related Hawaiian crickets Laupala paranigra and Laupala kohalensis have indirectly suggested that many of the genes underlying the difference in pulse rate of male song are physically linked with genes underlying the difference in female preference for pulse rate. Using marker-assisted introgression, we moved 'slow pulse rate' alleles from L. paranigra at five known quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying male pulse rate into the 'fast pulse rate' genetic background of L. kohalensis and assessed the effect of these loci on female preference. An astounding four out of five song QTL predicted the preferences of female fourth-generation backcrosses, providing direct evidence for the extensive genetic linkage of song and preference in one of the fastest diversifying genera currently known.},

  Abstract                 = {Diverging sexual communication systems can lead to the evolution of new species that no longer recognize each other as potential mates. The coevolution of male and female components of sexual communication is facilitated by physical linkage between genes underlying signals and preferences. By crossing two closely related Hawaiian crickets (Laupala kohalensis and Laupala paranigra) with vastly different song pulse rates and female preferences, and assessing segregation of songs and preferences among second generation backcrosses, we show a strong genetic correlation between song and preference variation. Furthermore, multiple, but not all, quantitative trait loci underlying song variation also predict female preferences. This physical linkage or pleiotropy may have facilitated the striking diversification of pulse rates observed among Laupala species in conjunction with one of the most rapid species radiations so far recorded.},

  Abstract                 = {Natural selection and demographic forces can have similar effects on patterns of DNA polymorphism. Therefore, to infer selection from samples of DNA sequences, one must simultaneously account for demographic effects. Here we take a model-based approach to this problem by developing predictions for patterns of polymorphism in the presence of both population size change and natural selection. If data are available from different functional classes of variation, and a priori information suggests that mutations in one of those classes are selectively neutral, then the putatively neutral class can be used to infer demographic parameters, and inferences regarding selection on other classes can be performed given demographic parameter estimates. This procedure is more robust to assumptions regarding the true underlying demography than previous approaches to detecting and analyzing selection. We apply this method to a large polymorphism data set from 301 human genes and find (i) widespread negative selection acting on standing nonsynonymous variation, (ii) that the fitness effects of nonsynonymous mutations are well predicted by several measures of amino acid exchangeability, especially site-specific methods, and (iii) strong evidence for very recent population growth.},

A recent method called restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) allows to sample sequence information at reduced complexity across a target genome using the Illumina platform. Single-end RAD-seq has proven to provide a large number of informative genetic markers in reference as well as non-reference organisms. RESULTS: Here, we present a method for de-novo assembly of paired-end RAD-seq data in order to produce extended contigs flanking a restriction site. We were able to reconstruct one tenth of the guppy genome represented by 200-500 bp contigs associated to EcoRI recognition sites. In addition, these contigs were used as reference allowing the detection of thousands of new polymorphic markers that are informative for mapping and population genetic studies in the guppy.

  Abstract                 = {The location and survival of trees in the coldest stages of the last full-glacial has long been of interest to palaeoecologists, biogeographers, archaeologists and geneticists alike. In particular, where species survived in isolated refugia and the influence that this has had upon the long-term ancestry of the populations, remain key research questions. However, the exact location of refugia during the coldest stages of the full-glacial still remains illusive for many species of fauna and flora, with different lines of evidence often being at odds. This is particularly true for Europe. Emerging evidence from various fossil proxies, palaeoclimatic modelling and genetic research is starting to suggest that the traditional paradigm that trees were restricted to southern Europe and in particular the three southern peninsulas (Balkan, Italian and Iberian) during the full-glacial is questionable. This is backed by increasing evidence, including 151 14C-dated and identified pieces of macrofossil charcoal wood from 40 localities in central and eastern Europe to indicate that during the last full-glacial populations of coniferous and some deciduous trees grew much further north and east than previously assumed. This paper reviews the fossil evidence and considers it alongside genetic and palaeoclimatic evidence in order to contribute towards a newly emerging synthesis of the full-glacial refugial localities in Europe and their influence upon the ancestry of European species. Plotted against a new high-resolution millennial time-scale for the interval ‚àº32‚Äì‚àº16 ka \{BP\} in Greenland our evidence shows that coniferous as well as some broadleaf trees were continuously present throughout those interstadial/stadial cycles for which there are adequate data. },

A low but persistent presence of fossil tree pollen in central and southern European full-glacial paleoecological sequences has been interpreted either as representing long-distance pollen transport from southerly refuges or as representing in situ refugial populations. Here we present macroscopic charcoal results from 31 sequences located throughout Hungary that provide unequivocal evidence for the presence of at least seven different tree types between approximately 32,500 and 16,500 14C yr B.P. This evidence is presented in conjunction with molluscan and pollen analyses to indicate that during the last full-glaciation, trees grew as far north as Hungary, probably in microenvironmentally favorable sites. These areas provided an important cold-stage refugium for the European flora and fauna. },

  Abstract                 = {As mitochondria are inherited in a matrilinear way, an animal hybrid contains the mitochondrial DNA of its 'mother species'. Of 80 studies that analysed the mitochondrial DNA of at least five hybrid individuals, 50 showed that all hybrids contained the mitochondrial DNA of only one of the two parental species, indicating either mating of females of species A with males of species B but not vice versa (unidirectional hybridization) or the disappearance of one of the two parental mtDNA types after reciprocal hybridization. I review and discuss factors promoting unidirectional or reciprocal hybridization and present a sexual selection hypothesis for unidirectional hybridization. The inequality of the sexes in parental investment leads to the sex that invests more being the more discriminating one. In the presence of conspecific males, females reject allospecific males and, consequently, a male in an environment of both allospecific sexes is unlikely to mate, while in the absence of conspecific males, females sometimes accept fertilizations by males of other species. Thus, hybrid matings are usually between the females of a rare species and the males of a common species, but not vice versa. Copyright 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

  Abstract                 = {Detecting groups of functionally related proteins from their amino acid sequence alone has been a long-standing challenge in computational genome research. Several clustering approaches, following different strategies, have been published to attack this problem. Today, new sequencing technologies provide huge amounts of sequence data that has to be efficiently clustered with constant or increased accuracy, at increased speed.We advocate that the model of weighted cluster editing, also known as transitive graph projection is well-suited to protein clustering. We present the FORCE heuristic that is based on transitive graph projection and clusters arbitrary sets of objects, given pairwise similarity measures. In particular, we apply FORCE to the problem of protein clustering and show that it outperforms the most popular existing clustering tools (Spectral clustering, TribeMCL, GeneRAGE, Hierarchical clustering, and Affinity Propagation). Furthermore, we show that FORCE is able to handle huge datasets by calculating clusters for all 192 187 prokaryotic protein sequences (66 organisms) obtained from the COG database. Finally, FORCE is integrated into the corynebacterial reference database CoryneRegNet.FORCE is an applicable alternative to existing clustering algorithms. Its theoretical foundation, weighted cluster editing, can outperform other clustering paradigms on protein homology clustering. FORCE is open source and implemented in Java. The software, including the source code, the clustering results for COG and CoryneRegNet, and all evaluation datasets are available at http://gi.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/comet/force/.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in sequencing technology promise to provide new strategies for studying population differentiation and speciation phenomena in their earliest phases. We focus here on the black carrion crow (Corvits [corone] corone), which forms a zone of hybridization and overlap with the grey coated hooded crow (Corvus [corone] cornix). However, although these semispecies are taxonomically distinct, previous analyses based on several types of genetic markers did not reveal significant molecular differentiation between them. We here corroborate this result with sequence data obtained from a set of 25 nuclear intronic loci. Thus, the system represents a case of a very early phase of species divergence that requires new molecular approaches for its description. We have therefore generated RNAseq expression profiles using barcoded massively parallel pyrosequencing of brain mRNA from six individuals of the carrion crow and five individuals from a hybrid zone with the hooded crow. We obtained 856 675 reads from two runs, with average read length of 270 nt and coverage of 8.44. Reads were assembled de novo into 19 552 contigs, 70% of which could be assigned to annotated genes in chicken and zebra finch. This resulted in a total of 7637 orthologous genes and a core set of 1301 genes that could be compared across all individuals. We find a clear clustering of expression profiles for the pure carrion crow animals and disperse profiles for the animals from the hybrid zone. These results suggest that gene expression differences may indeed be a sensitive indicator of initial species divergence. },

  Abstract                 = {
Fundamental biological processes hinge on coordinated interactions between genes spanning two obligate genomes{\textemdash}mitochondrial and nuclear. These interactions are key to complex life, and allelic variation that accumulates and persists at the loci embroiled in such intergenomic interactions should therefore be subjected to intense selection to maintain integrity of the mitochondrial electron transport system. Here, we compile evidence that suggests that mitochondrial{\textendash}nuclear (mitonuclear) allelic interactions are evolutionarily significant modulators of the expression of key health-related and life-history phenotypes, across several biological scales{\textemdash}within species (intra- and interpopulational) and between species. We then introduce a new frontier for the study of mitonuclear interactions{\textemdash}those that occur within individuals, and are fuelled by the mtDNA heteroplasmy and the existence of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene duplicates and isoforms. Empirical evidence supports the idea of high-resolution tissue- and environment-specific modulation of intraindividual mitonuclear interactions. Predicting the penetrance, severity and expression patterns of mtDNA-induced mitochondrial diseases remains a conundrum. We contend that a deeper understanding of the dynamics and ramifications of mitonuclear interactions, across all biological levels, will provide key insights that tangibly advance our understanding, not only of core evolutionary processes, but also of the complex genetics underlying human mitochondrial disease.

  Abstract                 = {Adaptation can be described as an evolutionary process that leads to an adjustment of the phenotypes of a population to their environment. In the classical view, new mutations can introduce novel phenotypic features into a population that leave footprints in the genome after fixation, such as selective sweeps. Alternatively, existing genetic variants may become beneficial after an environmental change and increase in frequency. Although they may not reach fixation, they may cause a shift of the optimum of a phenotypic trait controlled by multiple loci. With the availability of polymorphism data from various organisms, including humans and chimpanzees, it has become possible to detect molecular evidence of adaptation and to estimate the strength and target of positive selection. In this review, we discuss the two competing models of adaptation and suitable approaches for detecting the footprints of positive selection on the molecular level.},

This may not have been too problematic for many phylogenetic studies, in which the gene is carefully chosen for, among other things, ease of alignment. However, in a comparative genomics study, the same statistical methods are applied repeatedly on thousands of genes, many of which will be difficult to align. Using genomic data from seven yeast species, we show that uncertainty in the alignment can lead to several problems, including different alignment methods resulting in different conclusions.},

Measurements of sequence differentiation and identification of genes in these regions is important but difficult, especially in organisms with limited genetic information available. We have followed up a genome scan in the marine gastropod, Littorina saxatilis, by searching a bacterial artificial chromosome library with differentiated and undifferentiated markers, sequencing four bacterial artificial chromosomes and then analysing sequence variation in population samples for fragments at, and close to the original marker polymorphisms. We show that sequence differentiation follows the patterns expected from the original marker frequencies, that differentiated markers identify independent and highly localized sites and that these sites fall outside coding regions. Two differentiated loci are characterized by insertions of putative transposable elements that appear to have increased in frequency recently and which might influence expression of downstream genes. These results provide strong candidate loci for the study of local adaptation in Littorina. They demonstrate an approach that can be applied to follow up genome scans in other taxa and they show that the genome scan approach can lead rapidly to candidate genes in nonmodel organisms.},

It ignores the topology of the gene tree and treats the coalescent as a Markov process describing the decay in the number of ancestors of a sample of genes as one proceeds backward in time. The matrix formulation of this process is convenient when the population changes in size, because such changes affect only the eigenvalues of the transition matrix, not the eigenvectors. The model is used here to calculate the expectation of the site frequency spectrum under various assumptions about population history. To illustrate how this method can be used with data, we then use it in conjunction with a set of SNPs to test hypotheses about the history of human population size.},

Overall, rates of resource collapse increased and recovery potential, stability, and water quality decreased exponentially with declining diversity. Restoration of biodiversity, in contrast, increased productivity fourfold and decreased variability by 21\%, on average. We conclude that marine biodiversity loss is increasingly impairing the ocean's capacity to provide food, maintain water quality, and recover from perturbations.

Yet 63% of assessed fish stocks worldwide still require rebuilding, and even lower exploitation rates are needed to reverse the collapse of vulnerable species. Combined fisheries and conservation objectives can be achieved by merging diverse management actions, including catch restrictions, gear modification, and closed areas, depending on local context.

Here we report the results from an epistatic QTL analysis of an F2 cross between a wild population and a standard laboratory strain of zebrafish. This further analysis was performed using a simultaneous search to identify epistatically interacting QTL affecting behavioural and morphological traits and uncovered several novel epistatic interactions that reached either genome-wide or suggestive significance levels as determined by a randomisation testing approach. These results provide novel insight into the genetic architecture of the regulation of behavioural as well as morphological phenotypes and call for more studies of epistasis for this group of traits.},

  Abstract                 = {The zebrafish is an important model organism for neuro-anatomy and developmental genetics. It also offers opportunities for investigating the functional and evolutionary genetics of behaviour but these have yet to be exploited. The ecology of anti-predator behaviour has been widely studied in fish and has been shown to vary among populations and between wild and domesticated (laboratory) fish. Here, we utilise the strong behavioural differences present between a wild-derived strain of fish from Bangladesh and the laboratory strain AB. In total, 184 F2 fish were generated and tested for shoaling tendency and willingness to approach an unfamiliar object ('boldness'). Our results indicate the existence of QTL for boldness on chromosomes 9 and 16 and suggest another genomic region that influences anti-predator behaviour on chromosome 21. QTL for growth rate, weight and fat content, all of which are elevated in laboratory fish, were detected on chromosome 23. These initial results confirm the potential for QTL mapping of behavioural traits in zebrafish and also for dissecting the consequences of selection during domestication.},

Controlling for differences in rearing environment, significant inter-population differences were found in boldness but not shoaling. A larger shoaling experiment was also performed using one of the populations as the basis of a North Carolina type II breeding design (174 fish in total) to estimate heritability of shoaling tendency. A narrow-sense heritability estimate of 0.40 was obtained, with no apparent dominance effects.},

Adaptive evolution by natural selection is the primary force shaping biological diversity. Differences between closely related species in ecologically selected characters such as habitat preference, reproductive timing, courtship behavior, or pollinator attraction may prevent interbreeding in nature, causing reproductive isolation. But does ecological adaptation cause reproductive incompatibilities such as hybrid sterility or lethality? Although several genes causing hybrid incompatibilities have been identified, there is intense debate over whether the genes that contribute to ecological adaptations also cause hybrid incompatibilities. Thirty years ago, a genetic study of local adaptation to copper mine soils in the wildflower identified a locus that appeared to cause copper tolerance and hybrid lethality in crosses to other populations. But do copper tolerance and hybrid lethality have the same molecular genetic basis? Here we show, using high-resolution genome mapping, that copper tolerance and hybrid lethality are not caused by the same gene but are in fact separately controlled by two tightly linked loci. We further show that selection on the copper tolerance locus indirectly caused the hybrid incompatibility allele to go to high frequency in the copper mine population because of hitchhiking. Our results provide a new twist on Darwin's original supposition that hybrid incompatibilities evolve as an incidental by-product of ordinary adaptation to the environment.},

  Abstract                 = {The unit of adaptation is usually thought to be a gene or set of interacting genes, rather than the whole genome, and this may be true of species differentiation. Defining species on the basis of reproductive isolation (RI), on the other hand, is a concept best applied to the entire genome. The biological species concept (BSC; Mayr, 1963) stresses the isolation aspect of speciation on the basis of two fundamental genetic assumptions 2013 the number of loci underlying species differentiation is large and the whole genome behaves as a cohesive, or coadapted genetic unit. Under these tenets, the exchange of any part of the genomes between diverging groups is thought to destroy their integrity. Hence, the maintenance of each species' genome cohesiveness by isolating mechanisms has become the central concept of species. In contrast, the Darwinian view of speciation is about differential adaptation to different natural or sexual environments. RI is viewed as an important by product of differential adaptation and complete RI across the whole genome need not be considered as the most central criterion of speciation. The emphasis on natural and sexual selection thus makes the Darwinian view compatible with the modern genic concept of evolution. Genetic and molecular analyses of speciation in the last decade have yielded surprisingly strong support for the neo-Darwinian view of extensive genetic differentiation and epistasis during speciation. However, the extent falls short of what BSC requires in order to achieve whole-genome 'cohesiveness'. Empirical observations suggest that the gene is the unit of species differentiation. Significantly, the genetic architecture underlying RI, the patterns of species hybridization and the molecular signature of speciation genes all appear to support the view that RI is one of the manifestations of differential adaptation, as Darwin (1859, Chap. 8) suggested. The nature of this adaptation may be as much the result of sexual selection as natural selection. In the light of studies since its early days, BSC may now need a major revision by shifting the emphasis from isolation at the level of whole genome to differential adaptation at the genic level. With this revision, BSC would in fact be close to Darwin's original concept of speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing captures sequence differences in reads relative to a reference genome or transcriptome, including splicing events and complex variants involving multiple mismatches and long indels. We present computational methods for fast detection of complex variants and splicing in short reads, based on a successively constrained search process of merging and filtering position lists from a genomic index. Our methods are implemented in GSNAP (Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program), which can align both single- and paired-end reads as short as 14 nt and of arbitrarily long length. It can detect short- and long-distance splicing, including interchromosomal splicing, in individual reads, using probabilistic models or a database of known splice sites. Our program also permits SNP-tolerant alignment to a reference space of all possible combinations of major and minor alleles, and can align reads from bisulfite-treated DNA for the study of methylation state.In comparison testing, GSNAP has speeds comparable to existing programs, especially in reads of > or=70 nt and is fastest in detecting complex variants with four or more mismatches or insertions of 1-9 nt and deletions of 1-30 nt. Although SNP tolerance does not increase alignment yield substantially, it affects alignment results in 7-8\% of transcriptional reads, typically by revealing alternate genomic mappings for a read. Simulations of bisulfite-converted DNA show a decrease in identifying genomic positions uniquely in 6\% of 36 nt reads and 3\% of 70 nt reads.Source code in C and utility programs in Perl are freely available for download as part of the GMAP package at http://share.gene.com/gmap.},

  Abstract                 = {A new type of fingerprinting technique is presented, based on amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Rather than two endonucleases as in AFLP, we propose the use of three enzymes, hence the method is called three endonuclease (TE)-AFLP. Genomic DNA is digested and two sets of adapters are selectively ligated onto the restriction fragments in a single reaction volume. No adapters complementary to the ends generated by a frequent cutter are added. Due to the addition of a third endonuclease, the TE-AFLP method provides a high discriminatory power and a reduction in the number of bands. The latter makes it especially suitable for the analysis of complex genomes. TE-AFLP fingerprints are suitable for detection by automatic fluorescent sequencers and are obtained in less than half the time and at reduced costs compared to a typical AFLP. The reliability of this method was investigated by determining the influence of varying digestion, ligation and PCR components on the fingerprint. Moreover, cross-experiments to study inheritance of loci were performed with a primitive insect and with tomato strains. The features of TE-AFLP are discussed in comparison with conventional AFLP.},

  Abstract                 = {The genome has often been called the operating system (OS) for a living organism. A computer OS is described by a regulatory control network termed the call graph, which is analogous to the transcriptional regulatory network in a cell. To apply our firsthand knowledge of the architecture of software systems to understand cellular design principles, we present a comparison between the transcriptional regulatory network of a well-studied bacterium (Escherichia coli) and the call graph of a canonical OS (Linux) in terms of topology and evolution. We show that both networks have a fundamentally hierarchical layout, but there is a key difference: The transcriptional regulatory network possesses a few global regulators at the top and many targets at the bottom; conversely, the call graph has many regulators controlling a small set of generic functions. This top-heavy organization leads to highly overlapping functional modules in the call graph, in contrast to the relatively independent modules in the regulatory network. We further develop a way to measure evolutionary rates comparably between the two networks and explain this difference in terms of network evolution. The process of biological evolution via random mutation and subsequent selection tightly constrains the evolution of regulatory network hubs. The call graph, however, exhibits rapid evolution of its highly connected generic components, made possible by designers' continual fine-tuning. These findings stem from the design principles of the two systems: robustness for biological systems and cost effectiveness (reuse) for software systems.},

However, it remains a daunting task to identify highly polymorphic and closely linked molecular markers for a target trait for molecular marker-assisted selection. The next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is far more powerful than any existing generic DNA fingerprinting methods in generating DNA markers. In this study, we employed a grain legume crop Lupinus angustifolius (lupin) as a test case, and examined the utility of an NGS-based method of RAD (restriction-site associated DNA) sequencing as DNA fingerprinting for rapid, cost-effective marker development tagging a disease resistance gene for molecular breeding.Twenty informative plants from a cross of RxS (disease resistant x susceptible) in lupin were subjected to RAD single-end sequencing by multiplex identifiers. The entire RAD sequencing products were resolved in two lanes of the 16-lanes per run sequencing platform Solexa HiSeq2000. A total of 185 million raw reads, approximately 17 Gb of sequencing data, were collected. Sequence comparison among the 20 test plants discovered 8207 SNP markers. Filtration of DNA sequencing data with marker identification parameters resulted in the discovery of 38 molecular markers linked to the disease resistance gene Lanr1. Five randomly selected markers were converted into cost-effective, simple PCR-based markers. Linkage analysis using marker genotyping data and disease resistance phenotyping data on a F8 population consisting of 186 individual plants confirmed that all these five markers were linked to the R gene. Two of these newly developed sequence-specific PCR markers, AnSeq3 and AnSeq4, flanked the target R gene at a genetic distance of 0.9 centiMorgan (cM), and are now replacing the markers previously developed by a traditional DNA fingerprinting method for marker-assisted selection in the Australian national lupin breeding program.We demonstrated that more than 30 molecular markers linked to a target gene of agronomic trait of interest can be identified from a small portion (1/8) of one sequencing run on HiSeq2000 by applying NGS based RAD sequencing in marker development. The markers developed by the strategy described in this study are all co-dominant SNP markers, which can readily be converted into high throughput multiplex format or low-cost, simple PCR-based markers desirable for large scale marker implementation in plant breeding programs. The high density and closely linked molecular markers associated with a target trait help to overcome a major bottleneck for implementation of molecular markers on a wide range of germplasm in breeding programs. We conclude that application of NGS based RAD sequencing as DNA fingerprinting is a very rapid and cost-effective strategy for marker development in molecular plant breeding. The strategy does not require any prior genome knowledge or molecular information for the species under investigation, and it is applicable to other plant species.},

  Abstract                 = {Plant species may remain morphologically distinct despite gene exchange with congeners, yet little is known about the genomewide pattern of introgression among species. Here we analyze the effects of persistent gene flow on genomic differentiation between the sympatric sunflower species Helianthus annuus and H. petiolaris. While the species are strongly isolated in testcrosses, genetic distances at 108 microsatellite loci and 14 sequenced genes are highly variable and much lower (on average) than for more closely related but historically allopatric congeners. Our analyses failed to detect a positive association between levels of genetic differentiation and chromosomal rearrangements (as reported in a prior publication) or proximity to QTL for morphological differences or hybrid sterility. However, a significant increase in differentiation was observed for markers within 5 cM of chromosomal breakpoints. Together, these results suggest that islands of differentiation between these two species are small, except in areas of low recombination. Furthermore, only microsatellites associated with ESTs were identified as outlier loci in tests for selection, which might indicate that the ESTs themselves are the targets of selection rather than linked genes (or that coding regions are not randomly distributed). In general, these results indicate that even strong and genetically complex reproductive barriers cannot prevent widespread introgression.},

  Abstract                 = {Genomic islands are clusters of loci with elevated divergence that are commonly found in population genomic studies of local adaptation and speciation. One explanation for their evolution is that linkage between selected alleles confers a benefit, which increases the establishment probability of new mutations that are linked to existing locally adapted polymorphisms. Previous theory suggested there is only limited potential for the evolution of islands via this mechanism, but involved some simplifying assumptions that may limit the accuracy of this inference. Here, we extend previous analytical approaches to study the effect of linkage on the establishment probability of new mutations and identify parameter regimes that are most likely to lead to evolution of islands via this mechanism. We show how the interplay between migration and selection affects the establishment probability of linked vs. unlinked alleles, the expected maximum size of genomic islands, and the expected time required for their evolution. Our results agree with previous studies, suggesting that this mechanism alone is unlikely to be a general explanation for the evolution of genomic islands. However, this mechanism could occur more readily if there were other pre-adaptations to reduce local rates of recombination or increase the local density of mutational targets within the region of the island. We also show that island formation via erosion following secondary contact is much more rapid than island formation from de novo mutations, suggesting that this mechanism may be more likely.},

Genes showing population-specific allele frequency changes, which represent strong candidates for altitude adaptation, were identified. The strongest signal of natural selection came from endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (EPAS1), a transcription factor involved in response to hypoxia. One single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at EPAS1 shows a 78\% frequency difference between Tibetan and Han samples, representing the fastest allele frequency change observed at any human gene to date. This SNP's association with erythrocyte abundance supports the role of EPAS1 in adaptation to hypoxia. Thus, a population genomic survey has revealed a functionally important locus in genetic adaptation to high altitude.},

  Abstract                 = {In some genomic applications it is necessary to design large numbers of PCR primers in exons flanking one or several introns on the basis of orthologous gene sequences in related species. The primer pairs designed by this target gene approach are called "intron-flanking primers" or because they are located in exonic sequences which are usually conserved between related species, "conserved primers". They are useful for large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery and marker development, especially in species, such as wheat, for which a large number of ESTs are available but for which genome sequences and intron/exon boundaries are not available. To date, no suitable high-throughput tool is available for this purpose.We have developed, the ConservedPrimers 2.0 pipeline, for designing intron-flanking primers for large-scale SNP discovery and marker development, and demonstrated its utility in wheat. This tool uses non-redundant wheat EST sequences, such as wheat contigs and singleton ESTs, and related genomic sequences, such as those of rice, as inputs. It aligns the ESTs to the genomic sequences to identify unique colinear exon blocks and predicts intron lengths. Intron-flanking primers are then designed based on the intron/exon information using the Primer3 core program or BatchPrimer3. Finally, a tab-delimited file containing intron-flanking primer pair sequences and their primer properties is generated for primer ordering and their PCR applications. Using this tool, 1,922 bin-mapped wheat ESTs (31.8\% of the 6,045 in total) were found to have unique colinear exon blocks suitable for primer design and 1,821 primer pairs were designed from these single- or low-copy genes for PCR amplification and SNP discovery. With these primers and subsequently designed genome-specific primers, a total of 1,527 loci were found to contain one or more genome-specific SNPs.The ConservedPrimers 2.0 pipeline for designing intron-flanking primers was developed and its utility demonstrated. The tool can be used for SNP discovery, genetic variation assays and marker development for any target genome that has abundant ESTs and a related reference genome that has been fully sequenced. The ConservedPrimers 2.0 pipeline has been implemented as a command-line tool as well as a web application. Both versions are freely available at http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/demos/ConservedPrimers/.},

  Abstract                 = {Microsatellite (simple sequence repeat - SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are two types of important genetic markers useful in genetic mapping and genotyping. Often, large-scale genomic research projects require high-throughput computer-assisted primer design. Numerous such web-based or standard-alone programs for PCR primer design are available but vary in quality and functionality. In particular, most programs lack batch primer design capability. Such a high-throughput software tool for designing SSR flanking primers and SNP genotyping primers is increasingly demanded.A new web primer design program, BatchPrimer3, is developed based on Primer3. BatchPrimer3 adopted the Primer3 core program as a major primer design engine to choose the best primer pairs. A new score-based primer picking module is incorporated into BatchPrimer3 and used to pick position-restricted primers. BatchPrimer3 v1.0 implements several types of primer designs including generic primers, SSR primers together with SSR detection, and SNP genotyping primers (including single-base extension primers, allele-specific primers, and tetra-primers for tetra-primer ARMS PCR), as well as DNA sequencing primers. DNA sequences in FASTA format can be batch read into the program. The basic information of input sequences, as a reference of parameter setting of primer design, can be obtained by pre-analysis of sequences. The input sequences can be pre-processed and masked to exclude and/or include specific regions, or set targets for different primer design purposes as in Primer3Web and primer3Plus. A tab-delimited or Excel-formatted primer output also greatly facilitates the subsequent primer-ordering process. Thousands of primers, including wheat conserved intron-flanking primers, wheat genome-specific SNP genotyping primers, and Brachypodium SSR flanking primers in several genome projects have been designed using the program and validated in several laboratories.BatchPrimer3 is a comprehensive web primer design program to develop different types of primers in a high-throughput manner. Additional methods of primer design can be easily integrated into future versions of BatchPrimer3. The program with source code and thousands of PCR and sequencing primers designed for wheat and Brachypodium are accessible at http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/demos/BatchPrimer3/.},

TE mobilization through 'cut-and-paste' or 'copy-and-paste' mechanisms causes their insertions into other repetitive sequences, gene loci and other DNA. An insertion of a TE commonly creates a unique TE junction in the genome. TE junctions are also randomly distributed along chromosomes and therefore useful for genome-wide marker development. Several TE-based marker systems have been developed and applied to genetic diversity assays, and to genetic and physical mapping. A software tool 'RJPrimers' reported here allows for accurate identification of unique repeat junctions using BLASTN against annotated repeat databases and a repeat junction finding algorithm, and then for fully automated high-throughput repeat junction-based primer design using Primer3 and BatchPrimer3. The software was tested using the rice genome and genomic sequences of Aegilops tauschii. Over 90\% of repeat junction primers designed by RJPrimers were unique. At least one RJM marker per 10 Kb sequence of A. tauschii was expected with an estimate of over 0.45 million such markers in a genome of 4.02 Gb, providing an almost unlimited source of molecular markers for mapping large and complex genomes. A web-based server and a command line-based pipeline for RJPrimers are both available at http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/demos/RJPrimers/.},

  Abstract                 = {Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) have become important markers for genetic mapping because of their ability to reliably detect variation at a large number of loci. We report here the dissimilar distribution of two types of AFLP markers generated using restriction enzymes with varying sensitivities to cytosine methylation in the soybean genome. Initially, AFLP markers were placed on a scaffold map of 165 RFLP markers mapped in 42 recombinant inbred (F6:7) lines. These markers were selected from a map of over 500 RFLPs analyzed in 300 recombinant inbred (F6:7) lines generated by crossing BSR101ï¿½PI437.654. The randomness of AFLP marker map position was tested using a Poisson-model distribution. We found that AFLP markers generated using EcoRI/MseI deviated significantly from a random distribution, with 34% of the markers displaying dense clustering. In contrast to the EcoRI/MseI AFLP markers, PstI/MseI-generated AFLP markers did not cluster and were under represented in the EcoRI/MseI marker clusters. The restriction enzyme PstI is notably sensitive to cytosine methylation, and these results suggest that this sensitivity affected the distribution of the AFLP markers generated using this enzyme in the soybean genome. The common presence of one EcoRI/MseI AFLP cluster per linkage group and the infrequent presence of markers sensitive to methylation in these clusters are consistent with the low recombination frequency and the high level of cytosine methylation observed in the heterochromatic regions surrounding centromeres. Thus, the dense EcoRI/MseI AFLP marker clusters may be revealing structural features of the soybean genome, including the genetic locations of centromeres.},

  Abstract                 = {Historical episodes of natural selection can skew the frequencies of genetic variants, leaving a signature that can persist for many tens or even hundreds of thousands of years. However, formal tests for selection based on allele frequency skew require strong assumptions about demographic history and mutation, which are rarely well understood. Here we develop an empirical approach to test for signals of selection that compares patterns of genetic variation at a candidate locus with matched random regions of the genome collected in the same way. We apply this approach to four genes that have been implicated in syndromes of impaired neurological development, comparing the pattern of variation in our re-sequencing data with a large-scale, genomic data set that provides an empirical null distribution. We confirm a previously reported signal at FOXP2, and find a novel signal of selection centered at AHI1, a gene that is involved in motor and behavior abnormalities. The locus is marked by many high frequency derived alleles in non-Africans that are of low frequency in Africans, suggesting that selection at this or a closely neighboring gene occurred in the ancestral population of non-Africans. Our study also provides a prototype for how empirical scans for ancient selection can be carried out once many genomes are sequenced.},

We have developed a unified mixed-model approach to account for multiple levels of relatedness simultaneously as detected by random genetic markers. We applied this new approach to two samples: a family-based sample of 14 human families, for quantitative gene expression dissection, and a sample of 277 diverse maize inbred lines with complex familial relationships and population structure, for quantitative trait dissection. Our method demonstrates improved control of both type I and type II error rates over other methods. As this new method crosses the boundary between family-based and structured association samples, it provides a powerful complement to currently available methods for association mapping.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT:Next-generation sequencing technologies generate a significant number of short reads that are utilized to address a variety of biological questions. However, quite often, sequencing reads tend to have low quality at the 3' end and are generated from the repetitive regions of a genome. It is unclear how different alignment programs perform under these different cases. In order to investigate this question, we use both real data and simulated data with the above issues to evaluate the performance of four commonly used algorithms: SOAP2, Bowtie, BWA, and Novoalign.The performance of different alignment algorithms are measured in terms of concordance between any pair of aligners (for real sequencing data without known truth) and the accuracy of simulated read alignment.Our results show that, for sequencing data with reads that have relatively good quality or that have had low quality bases trimmed off, all four alignment programs perform similarly. We have also demonstrated that trimming off low quality ends markedly increases the number of aligned reads and improves the consistency among different aligners as well, especially for low quality data. However, Novoalign is more sensitive to the improvement of data quality. Trimming off low quality ends significantly increases the concordance between Novoalign and other aligners. As for aligning reads from repetitive regions, our simulation data show that reads from repetitive regions tend to be aligned incorrectly, and suppressing reads with multiple hits can improve alignment accuracy.This study provides a systematic comparison of commonly used alignment algorithms in the context of sequencing data with varying qualities and from repetitive regions. Our approach can be applied to different sequencing data sets generated from different platforms. It can also be utilized to study the performance of other alignment programs.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding how often natural selection directly favors speciation, a process known as reinforcement, has remained an outstanding problem for over 70 years. Although reinforcement has been strongly criticized in the past, it is once again seen as more realistic due to the seminal discovery of enhanced prezygotic isolation among sympatric species and to a handful of well-studied examples. Nevertheless, the pattern of enhanced isolation in sympatry has alternative explanations, highlighting the need to uncover unique signatures of reinforcement to determine its overall frequency in nature. Using a novel dataset on asymmetrical prezygotic and postzygotic isolation among Drosophila species, I uncover new patterns explicitly predicted by reinforcement. Broadly, I found that almost all sympatric species had concordant isolation asymmetries, where the more costly reciprocal mating has greater prezygotic isolation relative to the less costly mating. No such patterns exist in allopatry. Using simulations, I ruled out alternative explanations and showed that concordant isolation asymmetries in sympatry are likely unique signatures of reinforcement. These results allowed me to estimate that reinforcement may impact 60-83\% of all sympatric Drosophila and enhance premating isolation by 18-26\%. These findings suggest that reinforcement plays a key role in Drosophila speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {Most studies of reinforcement speciation focus on the evolution of assortative mating, but R. A. Fisher argued that migration modification is likely to be a common alternative mechanism. Despite previous models showing that assortative mating and migration modification may both be involved in reinforcement, no one has determined their relative evolutionary importance. This is surprising because understanding the biological conditions favoring these mechanisms may explain why certain pairs of species exhibit abutting, nonoverlapping geographical ranges with habitat fidelity while other pairs coexist in sympatry with sexual isolation. In this article, we explicitly model the evolution of both mechanisms simultaneously. First, we explore how these mechanisms differ in their evolutionary dynamics. Second, we ask how they affect each other's evolution and whether the interaction alters their relative importance in reinforcement. Our results reveal that assortative mating may evolve faster and under a broader range of biological conditions than migration modification. However, direct evolutionary interactions favor migration modification when populations experience strong divergent selection. Depending on the nature of postmating isolation, these mechanisms may either interfere with each other's evolution or coevolve in the same system. These results illustrate the importance of studying multiple mechanisms of speciation simultaneously in future speciation models.},

We can distinguish different regional infection patterns that are associated with the distribution of pure and hybrid C. parallelus individuals. The northern pattern of low-level infection characterizes Cpp populations, whereas the southern pattern of high-level infection affects Cpe locations. These patterns converge in the hybrid zone and generate a third infection pattern featuring an extremely high degree of co-infection with the two Wolbachia types in hybrids. The distribution of Wolbachia among the studied populations encourages us to consider the possibility that this bacterium has a significant influence on the origin, maintenance and dynamics of this hybrid zone, given the reproductive alterations that are often associated with Wolbachia.},

Wolbachia infection showed no effects on female fecundity or a slight increment in females infected by F supergroup, although in the last case it has to be well established. Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is confirmed in crosses carried out in the field between individuals from a natural hybrid population. This CI, registered as the relative reduction in embryo production (sh), was of sh = 0.355 and sh = 0.286 in unidirectional crosses involving B and F supergroups, respectively. CI also occurred in bidirectional crosses (sh = 0.147) but with a weaker intensity. The transmission rates of the two Wolbachia strains (B and F) were estimated by the optimization of a theoretical model to reach the infection frequencies observed in certain population. To fit this scenario, both supergroups should present transmission rates close to 1. Further, we have simulated the infection dynamics, and hence, the capacity of Wolbachia to structure the population of the host insects and to affect to reproduction and genetic introgression in the hybrid zone. This represents a first example of the influence of Wolbachia in an insect natural hybrid zone.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a new set of algorithms, collectively called "Velvet," to manipulate de Bruijn graphs for genomic sequence assembly. A de Bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) that is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25-50 bp) data sets. Applying Velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb N50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb N50 on simulated mammalian BACs. When applied to real Solexa data sets without read pairs, Velvet generated contigs of approximately 8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian BAC, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. Velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.},

  Abstract                 = {Copy number variations (CNVs), a common genomic mutation associated with various diseases, are important in research and clinical applications. Whole genome amplification (WGA) and massively parallel sequencing have been applied to single cell CNVs analysis, which provides new insight for the fields of biology and medicine. However, the WGA-induced bias significantly limits sensitivity and specificity for CNVs detection. Addressing these limitations, we developed a practical bioinformatic methodology for CNVs detection at the single cell level using low coverage massively parallel sequencing. This method consists of GC correction for WGA-induced bias removal, binary segmentation algorithm for locating CNVs breakpoints, and dynamic threshold determination for final signals filtering. Afterwards, we evaluated our method with seven test samples using low coverage sequencing (4∼9.5\%). Four single-cell samples from peripheral blood, whose karyotypes were confirmed by whole genome sequencing analysis, were acquired. Three other test samples derived from blastocysts whose karyotypes were confirmed by SNP-array analysis were also recruited. The detection results for CNVs of larger than 1 Mb were highly consistent with confirmed results reaching 99.63\% sensitivity and 97.71\% specificity at base-pair level. Our study demonstrates the potential to overcome WGA-bias and to detect CNVs (>1 Mb) at the single cell level through low coverage massively parallel sequencing. It highlights the potential for CNVs research on single cells or limited DNA samples and may prove as a promising tool for research and clinical applications, such as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis/screening, fetal nucleated red blood cells research and cancer heterogeneity analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {The identification of cancer drivers is a major goal of current cancer research. Finding driver genes within large chromosomal events is especially challenging because such alterations encompass many genes. Previously, we demonstrated that zebrafish malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aneuploid, much like human tumors. In this study, we examined 147 zebrafish MPNSTs by massively parallel sequencing and identified both large and focal copy number alterations (CNAs). Given the low degree of conserved synteny between fish and mammals, we reasoned that comparative analyses of CNAs from fish versus human MPNSTs would enable elimination of a large proportion of passenger mutations, especially on large CNAs. We established a list of orthologous genes between human and zebrafish, which includes approximately two-thirds of human protein-coding genes. For the subset of these genes found in human MPNST CNAs, only one quarter of their orthologues were co-gained or co-lost in zebrafish, dramatically narrowing the list of candidate cancer drivers for both focal and large CNAs. We conclude that zebrafish-human comparative analysis represents a powerful, and broadly applicable, tool to enrich for evolutionarily conserved cancer drivers.},

  Abstract                 = {The emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has significantly improved sequencing throughput and reduced costs. However, the short read length, duplicate reads and massive volume of data make the data processing much more difficult and complicated than the first-generation sequencing technology. Although there are some software packages developed to assess the data quality, those packages either are not easily available to users or require bioinformatics skills and computer resources. Moreover, almost all the quality assessment software currently available didn't taken into account the sequencing errors when dealing with the duplicate assessment in NGS data. Here, we present a new user-friendly quality assessment software package called BIGpre, which works for both Illumina and 454 platforms. BIGpre contains all the functions of other quality assessment software, such as the correlation between forward and reverse reads, read GC-content distribution, and base Ns quality. More importantly, BIGpre incorporates associated programs to detect and remove duplicate reads after taking sequencing errors into account and trimming low quality reads from raw data as well. BIGpre is primarily written in Perl and integrates graphical capability from the statistics package R. This package produces both tabular and graphical summaries of data quality for sequencing datasets from Illumina and 454 platforms. Processing hundreds of millions reads within minutes, this package provides immediate diagnostic information for user to manipulate sequencing data for downstream analyses. BIGpre is freely available at http://bigpre.sourceforge.net.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Complete organellar genome sequences (chloroplasts and mitochondria) provide valuable resources and information for studying plant molecular ecology and evolution. As high-throughput sequencing technology advances, it becomes the norm that a shotgun approach is used to obtain complete genome sequences. Therefore, to assemble organellar sequences from the whole genome, shotgun reads are inevitable. However, associated techniques are often cumbersome, time-consuming, and difficult, because true organellar DNA is difficult to separate efficiently from nuclear copies, which have been transferred to the nucleus through the course of evolution. RESULTS: We report a new, rapid procedure for plant chloroplast and mitochondrial genome sequencing and assembly using the Roche/454 GS FLX platform. Plant cells can contain multiple copies of the organellar genomes, and there is a significant correlation between the depth of sequence reads in contigs and the number of copies of the genome. Without isolating organellar DNA from the mixture of nuclear and organellar DNA for sequencing, we retrospectively extracted assembled contigs of either chloroplast or mitochondrial sequences from the whole genome shotgun data. Moreover, the contig connection graph property of Newbler (a platform-specific sequence assembler) ensures an efficient final assembly. Using this procedure, we assembled both chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of a resurrection plant, Boea hygrometrica, with high fidelity. We also present information and a minimal sequence dataset as a reference for the assembly of other plant organellar genomes.},

Considering the computational time, maximum random access memory (RAM) occupancy, assembly accuracy and integrity, our study indicate that string-based assemblers, overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) assemblers are well-suited for very short reads and longer reads of small genomes respectively. For large datasets of more than hundred millions of short reads, De Bruijn graph-based assemblers would be more appropriate. In terms of software implementation, string-based assemblers are superior to graph-based ones, of which SOAPdenovo is complex for the creation of configuration file.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: New genes generated by retroposition are widespread in humans and other mammalian species. Usually, this process copies a single parental gene and inserts it into a distant genomic location. However, retroposition of two adjacent parental genes, i.e. co-retroposition, had not been reported until the hominoid chimeric gene, PIPSL, was identified recently. It was shown how two genes linked in tandem (phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, type I, alpha, PIP5K1A and proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase, 4, PSMD4) could be co-retroposed from a single RNA molecule to form this novel chimeric gene. However, understanding of the origination and biological function of PIPSL requires determination of the coding potential of this gene as well as the evolutionary forces acting on its hominoid copies. RESULTS: We tackled these problems by analyzing the evolutionary signature in both within-species variation and between species divergence in the sequence and structure of the gene. We revealed a significant evolutionary signature: the coding region has significantly lower sequence variation, especially insertions and deletions, suggesting that the human copy may encode a protein. Moreover, a survey across five different hominoid species revealed that all adaptive changes of PSMD4-derived regions occurred on branches leading to human and chimp rather than other hominoid lineages. Finally, computational analysis suggests testis-specific transcription of PIPSL is regulated by tissue-dependent methylation rather than some transcriptional leakage. CONCLUSION: Therefore, this set of analyses showed that PIPSL is an extraordinary co-retroposed protein-coding gene that may participate in the male functions of humans and its close relatives.},

  Abstract                 = {Multilocus DNA markers [random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLPs)] are important for population studies because they reveal many polymorphic loci distributed over the genome. The markers are dominant, that is two phenotypes are distinguished at each locus, with a band and with no band. The latter one represents null-homozygotes with unamplified, recessive null-alleles. The frequency of a null-allele can be estimated by taking the square root of the fraction of individuals with no band. Lynch and Milligan (1994) have suggested a modified procedure that reduces bias introduced by the square-root transform. However, the procedure recommends to ignore those samples in which fewer than four null-homozygotes are observed. This may lead to significant bias in estimates of genetic diversity. In this study, I introduce a Bayesian approach to estimation of null-allele frequencies for dominant DNA markers. It follows from computer simulations and data on two conifer species that the Bayesian method gives nearly unbiased estimates of heterozygosity, genetic distances and F-statistics. The influence of a prior distribution and departure from Hardy-Weinberg proportions on the estimates is also considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past decade, attempts to explain the unusual size and prevalence of low-complexity regions (LCRs) in the proteins of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum have used both neutral and adaptive models. This past research has offered conflicting explanations for LCR characteristics and their role in, and influence on, the evolution of genome structure. Here we show that P. falciparum LCRs (PfLCRs) are not a single phenomenon, but rather consist of at least three distinct types of sequence, and this heterogeneity is the source of the conflict in the literature. Using molecular and population genetics, we show that these families of PfLCRs are evolving by different mechanisms. One of these families, named here the HighGC family, is of particular interest because these LCRs act as recombination hotspots, both in genes under positive selection for high levels of diversity which can be created by recombination (antigens) and those likely to be evolving neutrally or under negative selection (metabolic enzymes). We discuss how the discovery of these distinct species of PfLCRs helps to resolve previous contradictory studies on LCRs in malaria and contributes to our understanding of the evolution of the of the parasite's unusual genome.},

  Abstract                 = {Hybridization may lead to introgression of genes among species. Introgression may be bidirectional or unidirectional, depending on factors such as the demography of the hybridizing species, or the nature of reproductive barriers between them. Previous microsatellite studies suggested bidirectional introgression between diploid Betula nana (dwarf birch) and tetraploid B.¬†pubescens (downy birch) and also between B.¬†pubescens and diploid B.¬†pendula (silver birch) in Britain. Here, we analyse introgression among these species using 51¬†237 variants in restriction site-associated (RAD) markers in 194 individuals, called with allele dosages in the tetraploids. In contrast to the microsatellite study, we found unidirectional introgression into B.¬†pubescens from both of the diploid species. This pattern fits better with the expected nature of the reproductive barrier between diploids and tetraploids. As in the microsatellite study, introgression into B.¬†pubescens showed clear clines with increasing introgression from B.¬†nana in the north and from B.¬†pendula in the south. Unlike B.¬†pendula alleles, introgression of B.¬†nana alleles was found far from the current area of sympatry or allopatry between B.¬†nana and B.¬†pubescens. This pattern fits a shifting zone of hybridization due to Holocene reduction in the range of B.¬†nana and expansion in the range of B.¬†pubescens.},

  Abstract                 = {The increasing throughput of sequencing technologies offers new applications and challenges for computational biology. In many of those applications, sequencing errors need to be corrected. This is particularly important when sequencing reads from an unknown reference such as random DNA barcodes. In this case, error correction can be done by performing a pairwise comparison of all the barcodes, which is a computationally complex problem.Here, we address this challenge and describe an exact algorithm to determine which pairs of sequences lie within a given Levenshtein distance. For error correction or redundancy reduction purposes, matched pairs are then merged into clusters of similar sequences. The efficiency of starcode is attributable to the poucet search, a novel implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm performed on the nodes of a trie. On the task of matching random barcodes, starcode outperforms sequence clustering algorithms in both speed and precision.The C source code is available at http://github.com/gui11aume/starcode.guillaume.filion@gmail.com.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurement precision determines the power of any analysis to reliably identify significant signals, such as in screens for differential expression, independent of whether the experimental design incorporates replicates or not. With the compilation of large-scale RNA-Seq datasets with technical replicate samples, however, we can now, for the first time, perform a systematic analysis of the precision of expression level estimates from massively parallel sequencing technology. This then allows considerations for its improvement by computational or experimental means.We report on a comprehensive study of target identification and measurement precision, including their dependence on transcript expression levels, read depth and other parameters. In particular, an impressive recall of 84\% of the estimated true transcript population could be achieved with 331 million 50 bp reads, with diminishing returns from longer read lengths and even less gains from increased sequencing depths. Most of the measurement power (75\%) is spent on only 7\% of the known transcriptome, however, making less strongly expressed transcripts harder to measure. Consequently, <30\% of all transcripts could be quantified reliably with a relative error<20\%. Based on established tools, we then introduce a new approach for mapping and analysing sequencing reads that yields substantially improved performance in gene expression profiling, increasing the number of transcripts that can reliably be quantified to over 40\%. Extrapolations to higher sequencing depths highlight the need for efficient complementary steps. In discussion we outline possible experimental and computational strategies for further improvements in quantification precision.rnaseq10@boku.ac.at},
